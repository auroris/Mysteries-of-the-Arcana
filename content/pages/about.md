        <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">A Little Bit About Keira</span> (Artist: chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 3 pgs 1-29, chapter 4) <br>
        <span style="text-align: justify;">Keira W. has done a little bit of everything, from dumpster cleaning to door-to-door sales. She left the public work force in 2011 to focus on art full time.She takes art where she can get it, in various forms, be it singing, playing a guitar, or sitting down with a pad and paper. She's now 45, and came out as trans in late 2020. She's been drawing professionally since 2009. No stranger to RPGs, both pen and paper as well as online, she has a particular pull that keeps her hovering around the sci-fi/fantasy genres. Mysteries of the Arcana was her first published comic work. She was brought on board for the comic at the wrap up of summer 2008 and has been worked closely with J until chapter 3. The comic resumed with Keira at the helm to finish out chapter 4, then carried forward until the main comic went on hiatus in 2019.</span>

        <span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">A Little Bit About Mysteries of the Arcana</span>
        <br>
        <div style="text-align: justify;">Mysteries of the Arcana's genesis began back in the days of 2400 baud modems and dial-up bulletin board services as a roleplaying exercise. From that humble beginning it grew and meshed with J's interest in the tarot. At first, Arcana told the story of Chrystalline's father but, in time, the story became about Chrys and, finally, Chrys and Theresa.The making of a MotA page begins with a script, written by J and beta-read by a few dedicated volunteers. The script is then turned over to the artist. The artist and J hash out any changes that need to be made from an artistic standpoint. The artist takes those notes and draws, penciling and inking by hand. Color and lettering all gets done in Adobe Photoshop. The artist shows J the page in progress at various points in the process and, often, small changes are made. Finally, when all is finished, J posts so that eventually fans of Mysteries of the Arcana can enjoy. Curious about the artistic process? Check out the videos below to get an idea of how it works. <br>
