<p>Some bombs go *clink* *clink* *clink*. This one goes *squish* *squish* *squish*!</p><p>To answer some questions from comments on the last page:</p><p>BowentheKotoc: Yes, those are tentacles. Biobombs are neat!</p><p>Francisco: You asked an interesting question. Is Chrys's father on the side of the Void? Or is all not as it seems? I'm afraid I can't give any answers quite yet.</p><p>There's a number of natural disasters in the US as of lately. I hope any MotA fans out there in Houston dodged the first hurricane and fans in Florida and beyond dodge the current one. I also hope readers in the Northwest are safe from the fires.</p><p>Mostly, I hope you're all safe.</p><p>See you next week!</p>
