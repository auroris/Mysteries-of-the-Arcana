<p>Let me tell you. Keith read this page in the script?</p><p>He almost quit. Right there. Right then. I had to BEG and PLEAD for him to stay on as the artist. </p><p>"J," he said, "This page is TOO complex! TOO insane! You don't pay me enough to draw a page THIS crazy!!!"</p><p>So, I said, "Would you do it for a Scooby Snack?"</p><p>And he did!</p><p>See you Monday!</p>
