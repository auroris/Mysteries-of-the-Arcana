<p>As has been noted, the cellphone service in the US sucks. As does the cable service. And the internet service. There's a combination of factors for this - an unwillingness of the government to recognize these services as utilities as opposed to luxuries and a hefty amount of deregulation and lobbying on the parts of the cellphone companies. It wasn't until this year that we got a legal right to change carriers and keep an existing cellphone and even now, we still can't do it 100 percent of the time.</p><p>Anyway. Looks like Chrys is getting close to Theresa here. What's that all about?</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>
