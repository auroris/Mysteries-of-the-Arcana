<br> When the first bullet bounces off Superman-style, stop shooting.

<br>... Ok, the yuppies are bulletproff. What is their weakness? Let me guess, static cling, or a court order from their former mates to back-pay alimony?

<br> @weertangel - The art's a bit different at the moment&nbsp;because I'm filling in for the usual artist, Keith.&nbsp; Hope you don't mind the temporary change!&nbsp; <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">

<br> When I first saw them, their outfits and plastic look made me think department store mannequins (the creepily realistic ones you sometimes see), but Barbie and Ken works, too.
<br>I do find myself wondering how anyone captures one of these nightmares.  That and where they come from, are they born, summoned, manufactured?  They don't seem natural but other dimensions can be weird.  The thing is if they were natural I'd expect the other life here to also be made of plastic and/or nightmare reflections of earth.

<br> Hit them with a brick and stake them to the ground.&nbsp; It's a proven method!<br>
