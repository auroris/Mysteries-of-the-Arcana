<p>I don't think I have any begging for money this week. No RPG books I've written to tell you anyway. :)</p><p>More seriously, I want to take this week to thank everyone who reads Mysteries of the Arcana. If you comment or don't, if you read each update or come back once in a while and catch up. Thank you. Without you, half the story would be gone. A story needs an audience.</p><p>Bricks of the Arcana on Friday. New story comic next Wednesday. See you then!</p>

<br> I just finished that game series (&lt;3 it very much). What kind of telepathic temporal shenanigans are you pullin' here?! xD
