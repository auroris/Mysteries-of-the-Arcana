Lucky... or cursed. </p><p>Time to promote another Pathfinder-compatible RPG product. Not for myself, though! Nope! Keith Wood, the man you know and love as the artist behind this comic, has branched out. His first RPG product, <a href=\"http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/166020/Spooky-Gardens-Autumn-Special\" target=\"_blank\">Spooky Gardens Autumn Special</a>, was just released. I believe he has four different horrifying plants depicted in that book using his unique artistic skills. Consider picking it up and giving it a review, noting how much you like the art. Keith can always use more work.</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>",
