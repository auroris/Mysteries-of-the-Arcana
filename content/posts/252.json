It's probably the sweetest \"I knock you out with a brick\" gesture I've seen anywhere so far. I'm a tiny bit ticked that Theresa is so mean to him on this page after it's been shown very obviously that he did that for her sake.Yes, the action sequences of the last few pages were sweeeet <img src=\"//smilies/smile.gif\" alt=\"Smile\" border=\"0\"> Well done!Regarding what will happen... Well, I assume they'll run out of the camp succesfully, William will explain what the hell is going on (Hopefully!), and they'll then need to knock some dog heads to get their Vitamin X. Maybe hopefully fix whatever the problem around the place is while they are at it... Maybe.Yes, I know that's a pretty \"generic\" estimate, but since we know so little of that world (They reach it, there's a decaying building, there's dogboys on ants that aren't friendly to Theresa and that's about it), it's hard to do any better predictions than that <img src=\"//smilies/smile.gif\" alt=\"Smile\" border=\"0\">"
