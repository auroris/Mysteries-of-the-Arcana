When trying to get the page queued last night, I kept encountering a Gateway 504 timeout error, and eventually had to sleep.</p><p>Anywho, welcome to the finale of this short story. Seems Kietra and Aleena have reached the end of their quest, by finding....Quest! But something's not quite right here...</p><p>Hope you guys have enjoyed this installment of Tales of the Arcana, and we'll see you soon with the next installment.</p><p>Keith W.</p>",
