       <p>If today's page looks a little strange to you that's because, as he was doing what we in the industry call the flats (the basic colors of the page without the shading), Keith discovered he was running a fever. Obviously caring for himself overshadowed the need to get the page done tonight. We'll update with the finished, shaded page as soon as possible.</p><p>In the meanwhile, I am curious. I've been wary of actually sharing the origin story of the arcana with you guys. Not because you don't deserve to know it, of course, or because I think it is a bad story. Rather, I was worried with the slow pace of a webcomic (two pages a week) taking such a long break our familiar main characters might be a turn-off for readers. Even without the year-long hiatus we took in the middle, the Telling ran somewhere around 15 weeks. That's a long time to go without the main characters in a comic that is primarily about their relationships. </p><p>So, please tell me. What did you think of the Telling? Our origin story of the Arcana and the Keys? Please answer as honestly as you like.</p><p>See you Monday!</p>

<p class="comment_text"> </p><p class="comment_text"><br> I was pretty bored by the telling.<br></p><p>It is the kind of thing that might be welcome in a published work, or if the update pace was quicker. I wouldn't have minded, say, 2 weeks of updates on it. (As many comics as you like, but let's not stay off the story for longer than a couple weeks).</p><p>It's also the sort of thing that you could make as a for-purchase side story.<br></p><p>If you feel that the Telling is an important element of the script, I wouldn't have minded reading some text on the website, or some comics that are mostly text with just a few images (or hey, even no images at all, to get through it.) The Telling in particular is a part of the story that could be effectively told without the aid of pictures. Then if you wanted to go back later and fill it in, either for dead tree publication or for-purchase pdf, that could be great.</p>

<p class="comment_text"> </p><p class="comment_text"><br> I liked The Telling. As a reader who hasn't gone through the archives of the main story, I felt like it was sort of a broad 'here is a taste of the world through it's mythology'. <br>It's good to show other parts of the world besides the view through the main characters' eyes. The visual creativity of the first few pages of the Telling (particularly those first chimeric created animals!) were a great draw as well.<br></p>
