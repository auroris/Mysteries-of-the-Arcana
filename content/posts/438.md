<p><strong>Cameos</strong>: Gunsolo</p><p><strong>Hidden Names</strong>: Aleena and Bradley Potts</p><hr>
<p>Hello and welcome to chapter 5 of Mysteries of the Arcana!</p><p>A year ago, if you had asked me if this chapter would happen I probably would have shrugged my shoulders and said "I dunno". But there were people who refused to give up on me and on Mysteries of the Arcana. They poked. They prodded and finally I said "Enough! Okay, I'll get writing! Geez!". Of course, then the problem of "how do we pay for it" popped up but one very generous Kickstarter later we were ready to go.</p><p>Sharp eyes might have noticed a few changes. Theresa's growing her hair out and both Theresa and Chrys have on new outfits appropriate for working on the Beast.</p><p>You may have also noticed that this blog entry started with a listing of cameos and hidden names. For those who don't know, several people who backed the MotA Kickstarter chose a cameo in the comic as a reward and most people who backed the Kickstarter also chose to have their name hidden somewhere in the art of chapter 5. Today's cameo is regular MotA commentator Gunsolo. Can you find him? Here's a hint: he's wearing a fedora. As for hidden names, most days there will be only one but today there are two. If you guys can't find them I'll give a hint on which panels they're located in tomorrow.</p><p>This chapter has a lot of call backs to previous chapters. So, I'm going to borrow a technique from Dan Shive over at <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/" target="_blank">El Goonish Shive</a> and link back to relevant pages where appropriate. For example...</p><p>- <a href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/comics/323/" target="_blank">First appearance of the Beast</a>.</p><p>- <a href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/comics/356/" target="_blank">First appearance of this garage</a>.</p><p>- <a href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/comics/445/" target="_blank">And who is Ruby, you might ask?</a></p><p>Lastly, today isn't just the launch day of Mysteries of the Arcana chapter 5. It is also the launch day of my new endeavor, the <a href="http://goldendames.com/" target="_blank">Golden Dames Project</a>! The GDP's mission is simple: spotlight the strong, capable women of the golden age of comics. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday I'll be posting public domain comics featuring empowered female characters or talented female creators. I'll also be providing commentary on the characters, creators, books, and publishers! Please join us.</p><p>That's it! Thank you so much for reading Mysteries of the Arcana. Without our readers, the comic is just a lonely bit of art and wording wandering lonely about the internet. </p><p>See you Thursday!</p>

<br> Yay! Reference to an artist/comic I'm familiar with! (Have followed EGS for a couple years, now.)

<br> I found my name! It's the scuff marks on the bottom of the door frame on the 3rd panel, haha.

<br> Bradley's the Radiator grill in the last panel. And DAMN you got good eyes Aleena, I had to double the panel to see it <img alt=" Razz " src=" /smilies/razz.gif " border="0" vspace="2" hspace="2"><br>

<br> I presume Gunsolo is the monkey-like hood ornament?<br>Well, there's a way to engage the readers. <img alt=" Reading " src=" http://www.mysteriesofthearcana.com/smilies/read.gif " border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2"><br>

<br> Hah, I love it! Best hood ornament ever!<br>Money well spent. <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br>Aleena's name is well hidden, It took me a while to find it (before reading the comments, obviously).<br><br>Circe must have caught something worse than the flu if Blue is treating her...<br><br>JD, it's a lizard actually. It is originally from Ursula Vernon's excellent webcomic Digger (http://diggercomic.com/blog/2008/02/25/digger-361/)<br>
