Talk about their product? </p><p>When I go to conventions, I can ramble on about MotA to any stranger as they walk by my table, and take a card, hoping they drop in to see the story and stick around, but something about this text box always makes my mind go blank and all I can think to do is say something quirky and be all, \"Nice page, pretty, yes?\"</p><p>Anyway, see you guys on Thursday, along with one more cameo!</p><p>Keith W.</p>",

Unless this is some kind of magic morphing glove, I think the easiest fix would be to move the thumb over when she first saw it."
