We are getting closer to December 2nd and the return of Mysteries of the Arcana. Keith's working hard on the art as we speak.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>In the meanwhile, I'm working hard on chapter 5 and our upcoming Kickstarter. Today I'm very happy to say I finished chapter 5's rough draft. Sixty-six handwritten pages, not counting the three pages of flowcharts and the seven page outline. To celebrate, I'm posting the first page of the script up above. Its a fuzzy picture, taken with my iPad, but if you can read my handwriting you'll get a sneak peak of chapter 5!</div>
