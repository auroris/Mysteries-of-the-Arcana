As I was laying the chapter out I realize there are still two chapters of the main plot line to be told. </p><p>This chapter will be something of a follow-up to chapter 5, where the Inn was invaded and we caught a glimpse of a <a href=\"http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/comics/534/\" target=\"_blank\">mysterious dragon</a> who seemed behind it all. Questions left over from that chapter will be answered here.</p><p>You'll remember, as I call them, Hacker and Sniper. We last saw them in chapter 7, when they were engaged in the mass slaughtering of alien pirates and the<a href=\"http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/comics/703/\" target=\"_blank\"> rescue of Chrys's father</a>, a man who probably didn't actually need rescuing since he has the same abilities as his daughter and a great deal more experience in using them.</p><p>Do you like their new eyes?</p><p>See you Monday!</p>",
