Jess tells me she still has shading to do on this page but we both thought you'd like to get a look at what happens next.<br><br>Mandrake speak is, and I have mentioned this before, hard to write. I have developed some standard pictograms she uses to mean certain things. The red circle with a slash through it, for example, usually means 'no'. She uses people's faces instead of 'you' or 'me'&nbsp; because that is easier to depict, with pictures, than pronouns. Likewise, certain concepts such as 'more' are hard to depict so I often leave the off and let people fill in the blanks. So, in the last panel of the previous page, Mandrake is saying:<br><br>No more of your games! No more of your plans!<br><br>It seems Mandrake's gotten tired of Chrys's manipulations, too.",

At least the way I interpret what people write.Seems like I missed the previous update, so I had to go back a page to actually see the lines that Mandrake said. It was a bit confusing, because I didn't see how those three snaps with her fingers were supposed to be interpreted as \"no more games\" and such."
