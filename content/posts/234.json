  "text": "DxelA asked if Kludge and Melody saying \"tender\" together last page was a reference to the Disney show \"Recess\". The answer? Absolutely.<br><br>Geek and pop culture references are nothing new in comics, of course. Comics have been making sly (and not so sly) references for decades. Our own comic's done it since the very beginning. If you look hard enough you'll find references to such diverse topics as Kim Possible, 2001, and Keith's girlfriend.<br><br>Interestingly, William's sword is a deliberate attempt not to make a reference. I wanted to make a science fiction sword but NOT a lightsaber, so I went in the opposite direction. Instead of a blade of light, I made a blade of nothing at all.",
