Readers who figure out what today's page title refers to get an official Mysteries of the Arcana no-prize!<br><br>I recently read through the Anime Encyclopedia. It was interesting, if slightly out of date. Bakugan, for example, was missing, but I learned a lot about the Mysterious Cities of Gold, Robotech, and even the Little Prince, all shows I watched as a kid.<br>

<br> <span style="font-family: Verdana;"><font size="2">Does using Google count?&nbsp; I think I watched those movies, but then, there was a lot I watched in those days and don't remember until the name comes back to me.</font><br></span>

<br> I'm guessing the title refers to the giant, jet-propelled turtle, GAMERA!<br><br>

<br> Gamera is really neat, Gamera's made of turtle meat, we've been eating GA-MER-A!<br>

I think Keith said something about turtles being carnivorous... <br>The two of them look like tasty little people nuggets in that last panel.<br><br><br>

Using Google counts. I do it all the time.And ya'll are right. Gamera IS full of turtle meat! Or people meat, if JD's right, since this one might snap up the gals...<br><br>
