After all, those people who backed the Patron for MotA have been kind enough to pay for it!\n\nDon't forget, you have a chance to contribute to Keith's Christmas present. For every commission he gets this month from an MotA reader, I'll be paying him an extra $1. I'm hoping to be able to give him a nice bonus at the end of this month! Contact Keith for more information. There's a nifty button for going to his commission page to our right.\n\nIn other news, wave 2 of LEGO Dimensions is out! I picked up my Doctor Who level pack today. So, I now have:\n\n* Batman\n* Wildstyle\n* Gandalf the Grey\n* The Batmobile\n* Marty McFly\n* The Delorean Time Machine\n* The Back to the Future Hoverboard\n* Chell from Portal 2\n* A Companion Cube\n* A Turret\n* The Twelfth Doctor\n* The TARDIS\n* K-9\n\nI'm pretty pleased so far!",
