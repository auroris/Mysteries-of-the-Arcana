I'm waiting for a few more and then I'll make my decision. My hope is to be up and running again before the end of the summer if not sooner.<br><br>Thank you for your patience and your belief in Mysteries of the Arcana.",

      "text": "I had considered that, actually, but thought it unfair. First, art style is only one consideration. I also need to take into account dedication and compatibility. Second, some artists might not be, as they say, ready for prime time and are being brave in putting themselves out there. I don't want to expose them to the crowd, especially after what happened with Jessica.<br><br>Also, I'm not sure art should be something that's subjected to a reality-show like environment, even a little."

      "text": "Greg, I don't mean the April Fool's joke but, rather, how much of a thrashing her art got. Yes, artists often need thick skins. However, most of the people auditioning aren't professionals and don't have a lot of experience. I think the \"American Idol\" process is destructive and would prefer to nurture young talent, not crush it.<br><br>James, after I've made my decision I'll ask all the artists involved if I can post their audition pages in the gallery. I do want to share them, just not as part of a 'vote on your favorite' process."
