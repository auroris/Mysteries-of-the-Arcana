I haven't even seen any posts about something being wrong or things being delayed. Which is not to say that the only value this site or its creators have is in providing content for me to mooch off of. But historically no news is a clear indicator of lots of bad news, and I thought perhaps it would be worth at least offering a supportive hug, and my thanks for a really wonderful story. Even if it never continues, I'm glad to have gotten as much as we have."
