<p>Seems there's been some discussion between Theresa and Chrys for quite a while. So much so that they've already done some digging around in Kludge's hand-me-downs.</p><p>We'll see what William really thinks about Kludge's wardrobe once he's got some of it on...but perhaps the girls haven't thought it all the way out...since William is much more...developed than Kludge is.</p>

<br> I wonder just how elaborate this disguise is. For example, if William were to move his hand in front of his face, would it bump into an invisible muzzle?<br>
