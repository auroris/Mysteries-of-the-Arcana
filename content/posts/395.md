And, at long last, we introduce the Major Arcana. Born from the dreams of life on the worlds created by the Minor Arcana. Will the Major Arcana be friend or foe to the old order? Only time will tell. Or, perhaps, you'll find out more next week!&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>BTW, What do you think of our interpretations of three of the most recognizable figures in the Major Arcana?<div><br></div><div>Don't forget, Comic Creators for Freedom is raising money to give to Love146, a not for profit that helps the victims of human trafficking. <a href="http://donate.love146.org/events/comic-creators-for-freedom/e28365" class="" classname="" target="_blank" name="">Donate now</a> and you'll get a wallpaper that includes awkward school photos of over a hundred webcomic characters, including Theresa! See what Theresa looked like in the ninth grade and cringe at the horror! The fund raising drive goes until the 13th.</div></div><div><br></div><div>Finally, are you interested in auditioning to become the voice of Theresa and Chrys in our upcoming Kickstarter video? If so, <a href="http://voiceactingalliance.com/board/showthread.php?89492-Mysteries-of-the-Arcana-needs-YOU!" class="" classname="" target="_blank" name="">check out the details here</a>. Audition end on the 14th and we could use a few more voices to pick from. UK natives would be especially welcome for Chrys.</div>

<br> The wallpaper links in "Extras" do not appear to be working properly.

<br> Eggs. Of course. <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br><br>At first glance I thought the Transformer was wearing a ghostbusters uniform, probably due to the color and the backpack.<br><br>The Seeker's searchlight is a nice touch.<br>

<br> I think at least one of them is more than meets the eye!&nbsp;
