My current cable company doesn't carry BBC America, so I haven't kept up with Doctor Who. I look forward to watching the entire season, later, in one shot.<br><br>I'm also looking forward to the return of Eureka and Warehouse 13. I've been pleasantly surprised, too, by the second half of Stargate Universe's freshman season. I had my doubts but it is winning me over.<br>

I'm not sure what television has to do with the gigantic turtle, but I don't get any shows.&nbsp; I have a tv, but it's just for watching movies.&nbsp; I do catch some of the interesting shows online though.<br><br>Theresa needs a purpose, the old turtle is correct. What the heck is she there for, decoration?<br><br><br>

<br> Strange that the "knower" did not ask Theresa her purpose directly.<br>

Its a decorum thing. Theresa didn't address it so it starts off by addressing Chrys instead.<br><br><br>

<br> As I said: Crys:0, Giant turtle: 1. <br><br>Also, isn't that a lot of work for a cloak?<br>
