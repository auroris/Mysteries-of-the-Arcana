<br> Other than the possible physical issues involved not really a problem. We ARE talking about Sentient humanoid life-forms after all. Although I'm starting to wonder if Chrys has a mate in every Arcana.<br>

<br> No problem with furry guys, as long as they are sentient.

<br> As for the story: This must be a damn nasty war if prisoners are summarily executed upon capture.<br>
