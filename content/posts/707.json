The entrance/exit is via an old fashioned lift (of the sort built into sidewalks next to stores in some cities) which lifts her up to the pub room. It wouldn't pass a modern safety inspection but it does function.</p><p>Someone forgot to mention to Chrys that surprise parties are better held NOT first thing in the morning, I suspect...</p><p>See you Monday!</p>",
