Chrys and Mandrake have left the cell. Now all that's left is to escape the pirates... which isn't something we'll show. There are two more pages in this little arc and then we move onto the epilogue.<br>

<br> Between the three of em it would probably be a bit to easy an escape anyway XD

<br> So they're not going to get the stolen stuff back?<br>

<br> Well, the shopping trip was apparently a set-up, from what her father said, and Mandrake has her new boots on, i presume, so do they really need the other stuff?
