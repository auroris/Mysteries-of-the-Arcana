<p>This page should have gone up last Thursday but Keith was very, very ill and it took him most of the rest of the week to recover. He's feeling better, though!</p><p>If you will recall, Quest is convinced that the Baleful Gaze, whatever that may be, is watching the Royal Road for signs of the Dreamers. We know, for sure, that it is watching Chrys's dreamwalking - as she experienced last chapter.</p><p>So, will this mask Chrys's "scent"? Or will it simply let her give Theresa a goose?</p><p>What do you think?</p>

<br> Oh, come on, Theresa - you know it's gonna happen eventually ...

<br> I think Chrys is trying to combine strategy with snuggling. It would be interesting (and a bit funny) if she pulled off the double, so to speak...<img src=" /smilies/thumbsup.gif " border="0" alt=" ThumbsUp " hspace="2" vspace="2">

<br> It is a perfectly logical strategy. That said I'd be quite surprised if a goose or a nibble doesn't also happen.<br>

<br> Worst case scenario: They get to snuggle.<br><br>That or they'll exchange tiny parts of dna and both end up pregnant with each other's child.<br><br>That or they end up as a horrible mutant combination of both their bodies.<br>
