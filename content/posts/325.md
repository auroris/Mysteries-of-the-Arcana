Sorry about this page being late, folks!<br><br>One of the tricks to being a comic writer (and a writer in general) is when to explain and when to let the audience fill in the blanks. For example, some of you might realize that Theresa is using a decorative, digital storage device on this page. We haven't really seen one since chapter 1. Notice the distinctiveness of the shape. Very different from Chrystalline's. <br><br>By the way? We have pages of Theresa being clever and William being badass coming up. Physics will be defied.<br>

<br> Ya get the feeling his dislike of the uber-yuppies goes a bit deeper then he's let on? Or is he that much of a badass: " 666 horrors against myself? I dost say to thee: BRING IT!"<br>

<br> Nah.  I think he's like Superman in one comic where he finally found something to fight that he could hit with all his strength...

<br> That's a lot of horrors. And last time William fought horrors, one of them knocked his sword away. That had better not happen this time, because he definitely wouldn't get the opportunity to pick it up again. (Unless that's the part where physics will be defied.)
