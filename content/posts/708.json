They had a \"make your own\" bar where you'd pour on the batter, cook it, then add fixings. It was quite delicious!</p><p>These days, we make waffles and pancakes on weekend mornings, then freeze them for the kids to eat during the week. I'm fond of simple maple syrup (the real stuff). The kids like them either with powdered sugar or whipped cream and strawberries.</p><p>What do you like on your waffles?</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>",

With or without whipped cream. <br><br>Hommade jam is the best, just 2 thirds berries of any sort and 1 third sugar. Mixed and heated for about 20 minutes. Let it cool just under boiling point an mix in a spoon of conservation powder. Take washed and heated glass jars and pour in the jam on with the lid and let it cool. Serve.<br>Last edited by Guest<br>Edited 2 time(s)."

When I was a kid, I was also very partial to boysenberry syrup, and I'm sure I'd still like any kind of good berry syrup.<br><br>But I came here to tell you about a special treat that is made less than two miles from my house.&nbsp; There is a company called Woodinville Whiskey Company; as I'm sure you have guessed, they make whiskey.&nbsp; Whiskey is aged in barrels, right?&nbsp; And after one or two uses the barrels must be replaced with new ones.&nbsp; Well, before getting rid of the used ones, they now have been putting maple syrup into the barrels and aging that for a while.&nbsp; It picks up whiskey-like flavors.&nbsp; It's expensive: $20 for a 250 ml bottle.&nbsp; But it's really something special.&nbsp; I don't even like booze and I like this stuff.<br><br>So now that's my go-to present: when I want to give someone an unusual gift, I give a bottle of that syrup.&nbsp; Good on waffles, on ice cream, in coffee...<br><br>P.S. I'm not putting the URL because I don't want to make anyone think I'm shilling for this product, but if you Google search you can find it; and since it doesn't contain actual booze they can ship it across state lines.&nbsp; So if it sounds like something you would like, maybe give it a try!"
