  "text": "In my hand written script for this page, it literally has three spots where I simply wrote: insert horror speak here. It wasn't until I typed the script up to send to Gennifer that I randomly clicked around the internet for inspiration. That's when I came across an article about those shoes that are supposed to shape your backside as you walk... and how the company that came out with them got in trouble because they have no actual, scientific verification of the claim.<br><br>So, what about you? I invite you to write your own horror speak! Let us know what the inner plasticized yuppie zombie in YOU has to say!",
