I've really got to give Genn props here. Her computer died and she found a way to finish the page in spite of it. I know how hard it can be when a key piece of hardware craps out on you - especially when you need the processing power to run memory intensive art programs. So, thanks Genn. You went above and beyond the call of duty here!<br><br>Don't forget the contest, folks! I'm going to extend the deadline to the end of this month - so until 5/31/12. Right now we have exactly three entries. I'd love to see more!<br>

<br> I;m glad for the extention, because I've been wanting to do something, but have not given myself the time to even come up with an idea or get started on something.<br>
