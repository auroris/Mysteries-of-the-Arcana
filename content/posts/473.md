<p>Hidden Name: Yewell</p><hr><p><a href="/comics/489/" target="_blank" style="font-size: 15px;">Where Kludge Got the Duct Tape</a>.</p><p>Seriously. They tied Kludge up in duct tape. Like duct tape would ever betray him. Duct tape loves Kludge! Not to mention he's a dead-on shot with the makeshift rubber band slingshot.</p><p>And so begins one of the longest action sequences I've ever written. I had a lot of fun plotting it out. There may have been miniatures involved.</p><p>Okay! I'm taking odds and predictions. How do you, dear reader, think the fight is going to go?</p>

<br> I admit it, My first thought was "Now I'm just spitballing here, but Kludge is a pretty good shot."<br>

<br> Hmm How the fight is gonna go...I forsee a certain Mechanical Medico having his Restraining Bolt removed at some point. <br>

<br> Wow, Kludge is really good at aiming that.<br>As far as Surgeon goes, I doubt he will be of much use in this fight with or without his restraining bolt seeing as he has lost all of his limbs. It's more likely that someone (Kludge, since he's closest) will use one of the detached limbs as an improvised weapon.<br>
