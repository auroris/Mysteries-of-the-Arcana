<p>So, our protagonists have now "escaped" the pod bay and are travelling down to find their client. Seems like all is well, minus the impending ship detonation.</p><p>Perhaps they should get a move on. The ship isn't all that small to begin with, but at least they seem to know where they're going.</p><p>Join us on Monday for the wrap up of this particular short story!</p><p>Keith W.</p>

<br> Love the Lazer Tag target on "Sniper's" belt. (Sorry I haven't been on a lot lately, bit of a trail line of minor health glitches lately)<br>
