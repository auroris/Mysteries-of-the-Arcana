<p>So, J's still battling the plague, so today we get some filler.</p><p>With the upcoming story arc that follows "Dinner", we'll be seeing a bit more of our heroines, and exploring their "down-time" more or less. In that same spirit, here's something I cooked up and have been wanting to share with you guys.</p><p>I do have one other in reserve, and depending on how J's feeling, you might get to see it on Thursday.</p><p>In the meantime, well wishing and hearty smiles are entirely welcome!</p><p>Keith W.</p>

<br> Chrys must have been REALLY sick for Theresa to do a get-well card like that.

<br>Are those little flowers or fireworks on the lingerie?<br>I vote for fireworks.
