I have nothing clever or witty or insightful to write tonight. I think I'm going to go lie down, watch Doctor Who, and let the Nyquil do the job it was meant for. Knocking me the hell out.<br><br>Happy Memorial day to our American readers! Happy whatever day it is to anyone not in America!<br>

<br> How do you feel about this eleventh doctor?&nbsp;I have been having trouble adjusting.&nbsp;

<br>Get well J Gray!i myself have some trouble as well, found out my World of Warcraft acount got hacked, got barely any gear left on my chars... was able to get the password changed and made a ticket so they suspend the acount., damn hackers...hope they can change stuff back. 5 years of hard work, sigh, had to happen sometime...&nbsp;

<br> Curse those WoW hackers all to poop!<br><br>The authenticator is kinda invaluable in that regard, makes it really tough for them to get in and steal my coveted digital hoard.&nbsp; I don't know though, I think if I was hacked I might consider it a blessing, forget the lost loot and reroll.&nbsp; Experience all the good stuff again from a fresh perspective.<br><br>Hope you get better quick, J Gray, if you need me to step in and screw things up for you, just ask!<br>

Crys, I haven't had a chance to watch the new Doctor in action. I don't have BBC America where I live so I have to wait until the DVDs come out. The good news is, I get the watch the whole season at once.<br><br>Weert, I hope that hack job didn't set you back too much. That sucks.<br><br>JD, no worries. We're good. Thanks! <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br><br><br>

<br> I'm re-reading from the beginning because it's been awhile since I caught up - I seem to remember that this page was coloured before? &nbsp;Or am I mis-remembering because it's been so long.
