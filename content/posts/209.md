It was theorized that this goo and the memories Theresa has been forced to remember constitutes some part of the quest given to her by the giant turtle.<br><br>That theory's absolutely correct. I suspect many of you have also realized that the goo, coming from inside Theresa as it did, is actually a part of her. <br><br>If that's the case, why did it just abduct Chrys?<br>

<br>Maybe it wants to make out with her, u never know what happens when ones dark memories and desires take on form...but it can't be pretty, thats for sure.

<br> Perhaps Theresa wants to be alone right now, so the slime makes it so?

<br> Or maybe the goo is taking Chrys somewhere private to act out those dreams Theresa had in the "Devil" arcana?<br>

<br> I'd just like to say that all the "remembering" pages where incredibly powerful. I was literally moved with each page. Thank you!
