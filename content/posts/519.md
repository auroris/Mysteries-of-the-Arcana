<p>I know. You're wondering when this horribly produced LEGO comic will be over? That has to be the reason you've all been so quiet! The answer is, hopefully soon. I'm working on chapter 6 as we speak. Getting the script together. Here are some key words for the next chapter of Mysteries of the Arcana:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><inline><inline><inline style="font-size: 20px;">Hanged Man. Squirrel War. Void Monsters. Quest. Magic Bullets.</inline></inline></inline></strong></p><p>In the meanwhile, I hope you are enjoying this refresher on how the multiverse of Mysteries of the Arcana works. One of the problems with with webcomics is it gets spread out over a long period of time so it can be easy to forget important background details the Royal Road or Keys or Key powers.</p><p><strong>Good news! </strong>The <a href="http://www.patreon.com/user?u=452395" target="_blank">Mysteries of the Arcana Patreon</a> currently has 8 backers who have promised a total of $243 per month in support. That means we'll definitely be bringing you chapter 6 once a week for a total of 4-5 page per month (depending on how many weeks there are in a particular month). However, Keith and I really want to be able to boost that to two pages per week. To do that, we need to bring the total up to $320 per month in support. That means we're only $77 per month short! <a href="http://www.patreon.com/user?u=452395" target="_blank">Please consider supporting us</a>. Even a dollar or two per month makes a difference. It all adds up very quickly. To borrow a guilt-trip from NPR, if you love Mysteries of the Arcana and want to keep reading it, isn't it worth a bit of financial support?</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>

<br> In my area, it's been Christmas stress and getting over the tragedy that was 2014.

@Adamas: I know that feeling. I went through it myself recently.<br><br>

<br> As for me, I'm so busy at school these days that I've switched my comic reading to sporadic bulk mode.<br><br>I think the LEGO comic looks fine, and it's a nice change of pace while we wait for the next chapter. <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br>
