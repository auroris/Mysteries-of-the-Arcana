<p>Can  you guess which arcana are being represented in today's comic? There are four of them and they've all appeared in Mysteries of the Arcana thus far.</p><p>I want to give an extra special thanks to Wendy Wood, who created several of the panels that were used in today's webcomic. You should check out her own LEGO webcomic, <a href="http://commandercottontail.com/" target="_blank" style="font-size: 15px;">Commander Cottontail</a>!</p><p>Right now, I'm in the middle of putting together the components for the chapter 1 and chapter 2 digital trade books! These'll go out to Kickstarter backers first and then be available for sale early next year. Each book contains a bonus story. Chapter 1's bonus story features Theresa and takes place between chapters 1 and 2. Chapter 2' bonus story takes place before chapter 1 and tells the story of how Mandrake came to the Inn!</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>
