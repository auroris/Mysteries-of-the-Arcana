We'll be a bit behind in our update schedule for the next two weeks. Gennifer's in the middle of a big move so she has less time to dedicate to art. I'll post pages as soon as I get them, promise.<br><br>In the meanwhile, please enjoy this very amazing study Genn did of Chrys! Of all her character portraits, this is the one that blew me away.<br>

<br> Very nicely done, I'm reminded of a BE from WoW, sort of.<br>
