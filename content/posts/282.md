We haven't seen the chibis in a while. In fact, after some negative feedback I had gotten on their use, I hadn't planned on using them again. Then this chance for a neat little joke came up... something that wouldn't be in character for Chrys to say. That's what the chibis were made for. So, I brought them back to life.<br><br>What do you think? Are chibis a fun little aside? Or an annoying distraction from the storyline?<br>

<br> Fun little aside when used right<br>

<br> I agree with "guest J" - they bring a bit of comedy relief to an otherwise serious situation. &nbsp;And in this case, it fits right into the storyline! &nbsp;<img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">

<br> Considering her line? Pretty much perfect.<br>

<br> When used sparingly, I'm ok with chibis. And in a situation like this, they make sense. <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br>

<br> Is Mandrake shrinking, or her dress is growing? On the station it was a mini dress, coming to the top of her thigh. In Morks it was halfway down her thigh. And now it  goes down past her knees?

<br> A fun aside. They get to say and do things the real character never would.<br>

<br> +1 for chibis, when appropriate. And here it's very appropriate!

Uatchi, her dress is getting longer. That's a feature. It turns from a mini-dress into an evening dress, then shrinks back again.<br><br>Yep. That's my explanation and I'm sticking to it.<br><br><br>
