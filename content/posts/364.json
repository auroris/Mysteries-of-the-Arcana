It had something to do with some RSS readers not properly interpreting the special characters sometimes inserted into text by programs like Microsoft Word. Now, there is a filter in place to either replace or remove those characters. So, those of you who have had trouble receiving RSS updates for Mysteries of the Arcana should be in the clear. You should begin receiving updates now, right on schedule! If you are still having trouble, please try unsubscribing and then resubscribing. If you continue to have trouble, let me know.<br><br>In other news, we are holding a vote! There has been some grumbling about the color of Theresa's dress. Therefore, we shall use the power of digital editing to change it! . All you have to do to \"vote\" is to attach a comment to this journal entry telling me which color you would prefer. Whichever color gets the most votes will win! So, get cracking dreamwalkers!",

That green complements her skin color, but something is off. Can't think of any choice that wouldn't be biased, cliche or both. Such as red. :P\n<br>\n<br>P.S. I love the last panel."

      "text": "Well, I like this color, and it does compliment the color of her skin. However, I think I agree that it would be more my own interpretation of Theresa if it were a darker shade of green, what I might call 'hunter'. As for an accent color, I was thinking more of gold.\n<br>\n<br>As for Dataroll's comment, I don't see this dress as skintight at all. Clingy a bit, sure, in a way that definitely enhances the look of the woman within. But definitely not skintight. It's largely a slipdress.\n<br>\n<br>And for the record: I think it is quite lovely as is. But you asked for opinions, so there's mine. <img src=\"//smilies/smile.gif\" alt=\"Smile\" border=\"0\">\n<br>\n<br>PS: Gen, I _LOVE_ the look of Mandrake's body language in that last panel!"
