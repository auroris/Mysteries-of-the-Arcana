Today's our last status update before our return! Why? Because our first full, new page of Mysteries of the Arcana in over a year will be posted next Monday! We'll be following a Monday-Thursday schedule after that until the middle of February, when chapter 4 will be finished. By that point we'll have run the Kickstarter and we'll know if we have the funds to run chapter 5.<div><br></div><div>In celebration, here's the first new, full color panel of Mysteries of the Arcana finished in over a year! Its stretched out a bit but up above, please get a nice glimpse of the four Minor Arcana queens holding their very own universes!</div><div><br></div><div>See you next Monday!</div>
