<p>So, sick sucks big time. Finally starting to get over it now, so yay for that. Also, seems Chrys was scheming behind Theresa's back for Christmas. I'm considering this being done in two more pages, I believe. All that being said, who is excited to see what Chrys got for Theresa?</p><p>See you guys next week!</p>
