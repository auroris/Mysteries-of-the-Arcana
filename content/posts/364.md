I'm pleased to announce that any problems we had with the RSS feed should be fixed! It had something to do with some RSS readers not properly interpreting the special characters sometimes inserted into text by programs like Microsoft Word. Now, there is a filter in place to either replace or remove those characters. So, those of you who have had trouble receiving RSS updates for Mysteries of the Arcana should be in the clear. You should begin receiving updates now, right on schedule! If you are still having trouble, please try unsubscribing and then resubscribing. If you continue to have trouble, let me know.<br><br>In other news, we are holding a vote! There has been some grumbling about the color of Theresa's dress. Therefore, we shall use the power of digital editing to change it! . All you have to do to "vote" is to attach a comment to this journal entry telling me which color you would prefer. Whichever color gets the most votes will win! So, get cracking dreamwalkers!<br>

<br> You mean by using the power of magic, not that digital blah blah...<br><br>This is a magical world we've entered, is it not?&nbsp; Only magic can change the color of Theresa's dress without first stripping her.&nbsp; Come to think of it, forget the magic.<br>

<br> Well, green is her favorite color scheme... but she prefers the darker shades such as olive drab and the ERDL camouflage pattern colors. This lime green is too pale. She should have gone with a nice forest or hunter green combined with dark teal accent.

<br> If Mandrake jaw-dropped, how were we supposed to react? <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">)
<br>
<br>As for the color of the dress, I dunno. That green complements her skin color, but something is off. Can't think of any choice that wouldn't be biased, cliche or both. Such as red. :P
<br>
<br>P.S. I love the last panel.

<br> I'd suggest going with blue, it seems like it would go better.<br>

<br> For me it is less the color than it is the style of dress that astounds me.&nbsp; Most women I know, even the really butch ones, will wear a dress if the occasion warrants it.&nbsp; But to throw on a skin tight spaghetti strap that shows that much skin, well, based on what we have seen so far it seems out of character.&nbsp; I can't wait to find out what tomfoolery she got blackmailed or browbeat into doing that required such a thing.&nbsp; As for the color, I am a big fan of dark red on women with darker skin tone and hair.&nbsp; A really light colored dress like the one currently depicted will certainly catch the eye, but after it is done catching it there needs to be a point where the people looking on will see the woman as well.&nbsp; I think If she walked into the room wearing that color I would find myself staring at the dress all night, not the woman wearing it.&nbsp; Just my two cents.

Well, I like this color, and it does compliment the color of her skin. However, I think I agree that it would be more my own interpretation of Theresa if it were a darker shade of green, what I might call 'hunter'. As for an accent color, I was thinking more of gold.
<br>
<br>As for Dataroll's comment, I don't see this dress as skintight at all. Clingy a bit, sure, in a way that definitely enhances the look of the woman within. But definitely not skintight. It's largely a slipdress.
<br>
<br>And for the record: I think it is quite lovely as is. But you asked for opinions, so there's mine. <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">
<br>
<br>PS: Gen, I _LOVE_ the look of Mandrake's body language in that last panel!

<br> Yes, we've never truly seen Mandrake as a woman before (unless memory fails me). Now we do, and she's even more lovely.

<br> Hunter green with gold trim gets my vote.<br>

**Flinn (Guest)** (2012-04-05)

<br> I'm thinking a violet-purple colour... ;D<br>
