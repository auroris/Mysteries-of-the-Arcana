<p>And here we begin a new story! Fly Away Home, which details just how Mandrake came to live at the Inn! Art is by a previous artist of Mysteries of the Arcana, Sarah Wilkinson!</p><p>Bronze Hare and Kessy-Athena, to answer your questions:</p><p>Yes, the priest is a Hierophant Key! There's a story there and we might explore it someday.</p><p>And no, that isn't Vulcan Jesus. It is, however, a Hierophant doing a Vulcan sign! So close!</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>
