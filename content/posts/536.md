Firstly, sorry for the late update today, guys. J's been feeling the pressure and down a little bit lately, so here's hoping he gets to feeling better soon.

As for my big news!

A while back, DaveB, creator/writer/illustrator of Grrl Power posted an open call, looking for a colorist to supplement his work, and take a little of the load off of him while he preps for his Kickstarter as well as other things. I submitted for the job, and after some elimination and thought on Dave's part... I got the job!

My first installment helping him out went live today over at www.GrrlPowercomic.com. So, if you guys like a bit of comedy, beefcake, cheesecake, and superheroes, hop on over there and check it out. It's got a pretty hefty archive, but it's tons of fun.

Enjoy, and good day,

Keith W.

<br> Ahhh, I was wondering why Dabbler's purple was familiar to a certain cyber-fairy. <img src="/smilies/razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0"> Congrats Kieth.<br><br>And J, I have one thing to say to you...Do NOT overstress yourself to the point of getting sick!!! Dr. Adamas prescribes a hot soak with 1/4 teaspoon of Dragon's Blood oil in the water. <br>
