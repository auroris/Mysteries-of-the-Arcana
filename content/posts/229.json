We'll be seeing you again on Thursday!</span></div><div><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\"><br></span></div>Please note! Today's comic will be delayed due to some computer problems. We'll have it up as soon as William slays these nasty little viruses, Tron style!<br><br></span>William showed up again last page but this marks the first appearance of Kludge and Melody in person since Chrys told the story of her birth in chapter 2. <br><br>You'll see almost as much (if not just as much) of William and Mandrake this chapter as you will Theresa and Chrys. You'll also see some fun Melody and Kludge side plottage. Circe will also be making an appearance. As for Blue and the Surgeon? I'm saving their side plot as some sort of bonus feature down the road.<br><br>Speaking of bonus features, I'm working on a prose storyline for our upcoming print edition of chapter 1. The story will tell the origin of the Mysteries of the Arcana multiverse! Hopefully their will be many orders for the book when we finally launch it.",

But on the positive side, we finally get to see Melody a bit! Okay, we mostly just see her hair and her intact arm, but it's a start! <img src=\"//smilies/smile.gif\" alt=\"Smile\" border=\"0\">"
