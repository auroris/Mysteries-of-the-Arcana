<p>So, something you guys haven't seen in a long while. Pencils for a page. I've had some rough stuff going on in the real world lately, including a friend in a pretty back car wreck. Hopefully I'll be back on track and get things going again soon. Hopefully colors this weekend!</p><p>Keith</p>

<br> Hope your friend is ok. Don't worry about being a little late. We're (mostly) patient people.
