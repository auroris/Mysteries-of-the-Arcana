Here's a weekly update to let everyone know we are making progress. As I mentioned before, the script for the rest of chapter four is finished. Keith is working on the arting as we speak.<div><br></div><div>As proof that there is progress being made, I've posted a page of the script. Consider it an advanced preview of the rest of the chapter. I hope you enjoy it!</div><div><br></div><div>I should also respond to the comments you've all been kind enough to leave over the last two weeks or so!</div><div><br></div><div>Gunsolo, thank you!</div><div><br></div><div>Drachefly, I'm glad you signed up for us on Comic Rocket. That's a great service, as is Inkspace, and I'm glad to be part of both.</div><div><br></div><div>Aleena, thank you! I think you'll be especially pleased to see Keith returning.</div><div><br></div><div>Felix, thank you. I am, indeed, alright.</div><div><br></div><div>JD, MotA couldn't be awesome without you!</div><div><br></div><div>Jarin, I'm glad to hear that. I'm testing out a new RSS feed reader now myself.</div><div><br></div><div>WW, when I typed in "tarot centered webcomic" we were fourth on the list, after the webcomic tarot project and Tarot, the comic by Jim Balent. In the future, I recommend remembering "lesbian elf kisses" for a search term instead. We pop up first under that.</div><div><br></div><div>Ceridwen, I'm doing a test run on a MotA themed tarot card (using the art of the Devil card that signifies Theresa's power) right now. We're hoping to use three tarot cards (Devil, High Priestess, and Knight of Swords) as rewards for the Kickstarter.</div><div><br></div><div>David T, thank you so much. I'm glad the memory of the story has stuck with you. As the comic's writer, that's very important to me.</div><div><br></div><div>Osk, thank you for coming back regularly! We're going to have new comics up for you soon.</div><div><br></div><div>Haruko, yep! New comics soon!</div><div><br></div><div>Adamas, here's a preview!</div><div><br></div><div>David, you're absolutely right. I should have said something and communicated my troubles. I hope you can forgive me. I'm sorry.</div><div><br></div><div>Fairportfan, you've seen the work of our new artist. Its the same as the original artist. Keith W, MotA's original artist, has returned!</div><div><br></div><div>Eddie, glad you're here! Thank you.</div><div><br></div><div>CA Morgan, deep breaths all the way.</div><div><br></div><div>I'll have another update next week. Hopefully with an art preview.</div>

<br> That is one complicated page right there. No wonder you need funds to pay Keith with.&nbsp; Look forward to seeing it.<br><img alt=" ThumbsUp " src="/smilies/thumbsup.gif " border="0" vspace="2" hspace="2"><br>

<br> If all else fails, you can see if Hiveworks might be interested in some affiliation. &nbsp;If I know anything, is that the comics hosted by Hiveworks have a LOT of readership, and their kickstarters tend to utterly explode. &nbsp;Just ask Chloe from Go Get a Roomie, for example. &nbsp;I think last year's kickstarter was enough to fund her for the rest of the year in addition to getting her roomie stuff off the ground in the print world.
