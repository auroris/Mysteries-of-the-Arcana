A special thanks to Peggy, who whipped this up at the last minute.\n\nIf you're interested, you can go visit Peggy's webcomic, Samhain Night: A Dark Faerie Tale. It is one of the most gorgeous comics out there, I think. Beautiful textures and a wonderful understanding of celtic mythology.\n\nSee you Monday!",
