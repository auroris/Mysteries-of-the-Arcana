<p>I've got a special treat for everyone this week! But first, the chibis have returned! How awesome is that? </p><p>First, <a href="http://www.justwritecomics.com/blog//so-you-want-to-write-a-webcomic-interview-with-j-gray" target="_blank">I was interviewed</a> by Jaxo Roberts over at the "So You Want to Write a Webcomic" blog about writing webcomics, appropriately enough.</p><p>Meanwhile, one of my RPG publishers, Fat Goblin Games, was kind enough to <a href="http://fatgoblingames.com/fgg/new-freelancer-for-call-to-arms-j-gray/" target="_blank">give Mysteries of the Arcana a spotlight</a>. I'm writing a Pathfinder-compatible book on rope for them - it'll cover almost everything an adventurer could want to do with a rope in Pathfinder. Almost. Get your mind out of the gutter...</p><p>And now for the treat! A few weeks ago I wrote a drabble for the kind backers of the Mysteries of the Arcana Patreon campaign. This short story is canon and takes place between chapters 5 and 6. If you're interested, backers of the Patreon campaign who pledge $3 or more a month get irregular updates that include stories like this one. So far I've posted two and plan to post more in the future.</p><p>-----------------</p><p>“¡Mierda!” Theresa swore. </p><p> Something had tapped her foot, startling her and causing her to bang her head into the Beast's drive-shaft. Theresa pushed, rolling the creeper she was laying on out from under the truck. She expected to see a blonde. Instead, her visitor had purple hair. </p><p> Mandrake, the faerie, was fluttering about two feet off the concrete garage floor, somehow projecting innocence despite being dressed in cast-offs from the Monster High doll line. </p><p> “What do you want?” Theresa sat up, rubbing at her forehead.</p><p>   Images swirled into existence above Mandrake's head. First, an image of a roasted turkey and then a clock and, finally, an exclamation point. </p><p> “Dinner's ready. Fine. I'll be right there.” Theresa struggled up to her feet, using the Beast's front bumper for leverage. </p><p>That was all the work she'd get done on the damn thing tonight. After dinner there would be storytelling with Melody or chess with the professor or, maybe, a movie with Chrys. </p><p> The last idea brought a blush to Theresa's cheeks. As if the faerie could read her mind, Mandrake smiled knowingly. Theresa flapped her grease-covered hands at the flying annoyance.</p><p>  “Get!” Theresa growled. “Go!” </p><p> Images of little silver bells, Mandrake's laughter, followed the faerie all the way back to the Inn.</p>

<br> *Snicker* Well it's not like Mandrake can yell "DINNER'S READY!!!" from outside the garage.<br><br>And yeah apparently Quest likes living up to his name.<br>

<br> Quick thinking indeed.<br><br>Seems Quest has a history of being all mysterious and secretive. <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br>
