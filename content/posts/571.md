<br> I had the same reaction. Your art is very good, and often great, but occasionally uneven; so I was sure how to interpret this. If you were going for creepy, ripped androgynous viquirrels, you NAILED it. Otherwise the chest/waist/hip ratios and stance are giving off a very feminine vibe while the torso is very masculine.

<br> So... Has Chrys not been told about the obvious reasons of why you don't go rushing through a live fire modern-esk battlefield yet or something? I mean, it's sorta just common sense to why that is.
