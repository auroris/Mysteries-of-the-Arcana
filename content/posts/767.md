<p>So, William has really taken a backseat for a bit, and I thought it might be fun to see what he gets up to when he's not out with the girls, or drinking at the bar.</p><p>Also, my wrist is healing up, slowly, so I feel pretty good about being able to hop back in the saddle to do things for you guys.</p><p>See you on Thursday!</p>
