<p>Seems most of the festivities have dwindled out from the surprise party. Theresa has finished off her cake portions and finally is going to go nab her shower.</p><p>Upside: She does seem much more awake now, and perhaps she'll find something suitable to wear to go about the rest of her day. So, huzzah. Maybe we'll see what other fun goodies have found their way into Theresa's possession from those gifts she got.</p>
