<br> ...Sweet Andraste's knickers, that was longer than I intended it to be.&nbsp; Sorry!

<br> Ahhhh...the inconveniences of growing pains. :/

<br> Well, i'll give it a week or so.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, it was the art at least as much as the story that first pulled me in.
<br>
<br>Not sure i can stick it out if this is the new style.

<br> Not slamming the new artist <i>as an artist</i>, it's just that the style just doesn't fit my vision of the story or characters, and i don't see how you could revise those enough to fit.

<br> Forgot to say this before I posted that...but that's just an idea I had that you could maybe do...<br>Anyway, I'll still be popping in on Mondays and Thursdays for the updates, whatever ends up happening. <img alt=" Wink " src="/smilies/wink1.gif" border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2"><br>

<br> Gah! Vitamin X is mutating our characters! Scooby and Thelma have invaded the comic! The forcefields did nothing! ;p&nbsp; Yeah, this is going to take quite a bit of getting used to.<br>

<br> This is my first and likely only comment... I don't even remember how I stumbled across this comic, but it took only one glance for it to become a comic I read on a regular basis. I enjoy artwork, yes... but far more, I enjoy story and concept. I do not mean to demean the work done by any artists in saying that... all I am saying is that I loved the comic from the first time I started reading it, because the story and universe have a unique feel, something that I am always interested in. I'll be sticking around as a reader so long as you keep updating; best wishes to you and those who work with you now and in the future <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br>

<br>It sounds to me like Jessica was just being a baby about it. If Sarrah, who sounds like a professional, could honestly post&nbsp;the comment that she did above, then&nbsp;I say you were doing alright as a&nbsp;boss. On a side note, a true professional would never have burnt the bridges that Jessica did as she quit. You might&nbsp;honestly be better off with someone else.That said, please be careful. The artwork seems to be evolving into Order of The Stick. Just saying...&nbsp;
