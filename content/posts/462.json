Of course, if Baron Sir finds out he's lying things might not go so well for Surgeon. Or Kludge.</p><p>Some of you, btw, noticed the similarities between Baron Sir and the first Doctor as portrayed by William Hartnell. Good catch! He was, indeed, visually inspired by the old man. Meanwhile, Red and Blue (Baron Sir's minions) were an idea that came from an old Swamp Thing character called the Patchwork Man.</p><p>See you Monday!</p>",
