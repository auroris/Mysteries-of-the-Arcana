<p>Webcomic Trailer day three! Today we're promoting the<a href="https://www.comic-rocket.com/explore/the-sundown-boys/" target="_blank"> Sundown Boys</a>, a webcomic in the <a href="http://www.spiderforest.com/" target="_blank">SpiderForest Collective</a> (the same group Mysteries of the Arcana belongs to!). Be warned, this comic, while not pornographic, might not be safe for work in some locations. Sundown Boys also has an amazing sense of color. Never have such bright, beautiful colors told a story that felt so dark to me.</p><p>I'm happy to say Sarrah of Wilkinson <a href="http://www.rednebulastudios.com/" target="_blank">Red Nebula Studios</a> has completed "Fly Away Home", the bonus story for Mysteries of the Arcana's chapter 2 digital trade! This story tells the tale of how Mandrake came to live at the Inn. Interested in seeing a sneak preview? Check out the image below!</p><p><img src="/pics/abe3028baf49d0a9b7cb53743cb4fce2.jpg"></p><p>See you tomorrow!</p>
