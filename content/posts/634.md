<p>Okay! Because everyone was so nice as to submit an entry, I'm gonna take the time to respond to each entry in kind.</p><p>For those who want to skip to the end and see the winners, go all the way to the bottom of the message.</p><p>SirCrash: Aunties? That feels irreverent but fun. Like a nickname you'd give an enemy in the time of war.</p><p>JD: The Nothing is already the main "antagonist" of the Never Ending Story. While I can't say I wasn't inspired by that, I can't steal quite so blatantly.</p><p>Taletreader: Null elemental encompasses the idea well for reasons that are just becoming apparent now.</p><p>Six: Monster Void's adorbs. :) </p><p>Guest: Eliminar makes me want to break out my old He-Man action figures. Well done!</p><p>Blaireau Garou: [   ] is interesting but how would anyone by Mandrake pronounce it?</p><p>NoRAd: White Man/Men is interesting but they're only white to our limited conception. They are less the color white and more the absence of anything.</p><p>BowentheKotoc: Reality Eaters makes me think of a good horror novel about people living in an isolated village, worried that the "eaters" will come and erase them.</p><p>Insrtnmhre: White Shadow, again, relates to concepts that I don't think this creature embodies. Not white. More not anything.</p><p>Fairportfan: Awww! It was nice to see Chrys and Theresa in your icon rotation! You've moved onto Cheerleardia but still awesome. Thank you! AvoidMe is certainly something one should do with those nasties.</p><p>Fajuf: Void Monster. Spot on the nose. :)</p><p>Alexander Hollins: Your theory on shards of creation is an interesting one. I can neither confirm nor deny if you are on the right track.</p><p>Xade: Shanton as a pun on Shan't exist on? Clever.</p><p>Peaches: Tinkles says hello.</p><p>Lukkai: Holey Men? Yes. Yes, you went there. Bad pun sir! Bad!</p><p>Guest (Adamas?): Voidwalker's apt. Certainly these things move in "space" where nothing should.</p><p>Musicalife: Antimatter? That's an actual thing and not quite the same. In fact, one of these beasties would eat antimatter just like anything else.</p><p>Lyulf1: Everything's name should be Bob.</p><p>Nazzy: The idea of translating it to a different language is interesting but remember, everyone hears things in their own language. Or sees them, in Mandrake's case. English is the default because, well, that's what I write in.</p><p>Calimachus: Vee-nish. Now I'm imagining the void monster rising on the clam shell.</p><p>Gunsolo: Noth'un needs a Darth in front of it. I am DARTH NOTH'UN and soon you shall not exist!</p><p>AND THE WINNERS (plural) ARE!</p><p>SirCrash for Aunties (something I think some of the characters will call them in the future) AND</p><p>Taletreader for Null Elemental, which will be their technical name (though I might change it to Nullemental for the cleverness of it).</p><p>If the both of you would be so kind, click on the Commission Keith button on the right side of the page. That will list contact info for Keith. Tell him you won the contest and he'll hook you up with your free commission.</p><p>See everyone Thursday!</p>

<br> <a name="" target="" classname="" class="" href="https://youtu.be/WWaLxFIVX1s">Noooooo!</a><br><br>Interesting, they seem to have gotten rid of the Null elemental, but the blast took out all of them. Where they just blown off-panel, teleported somewhere, or have they been annihilated??<br><br>Is this the end? How will our heroes survive? Find out next Thursday! <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br>

Of note to the winners, there is also a PM system here on the site, and you can also ping me there, if you don't want to use my email. The commission prize is good for 1 (one) single character commission, fully colored, bust or full figure with a simple background.<br><br>

<br>I sense a certain lack of heroines in that final panel...I have about 450 images in Gravatar and eight e-mails registered ... and i keep finding new images to add.

<br> "What is the void monster?" &nbsp;Right now it looks like the void monster is null.

<br> Deserving winners, I'd say. Those names work rather well.<br>

<br> Congrats you two! (I'm might still call them Voidwalkers just to be ornery!<img alt=" Razz " src=" /smilies/razz.gif " border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2">).<br>But yeah, seems Mr.E's plans just became Null and Void.<br>
