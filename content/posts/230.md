She runs the Inn but who is she, really? There's actually a hint to her identity in an earlier page. Back from Chapter 1. Try to guess. :)<br>

<br>... I missed the hint, so I guess I'll be re-reading chapter 1! <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">Regarding the bill... If it's that extravagant, I'd say that Circe is overcharging.&nbsp;I don't think&nbsp;that Theresa has spent that much time at the inn, what with fighting hordes of mechanical monsters and having her past torn from her. If the bill is that high, she should just do a dine-and-dash. On the other hand, if the bill only consists of exploading goat frogs, I suppose it's not that bad...

Do keep in mind that at the end of Chapter One, Theresa did have two broken legs.&nbsp; So I estimate that she has been there (eating, drinking, sleeping, and storing her things) for several months already if not close to a year.&nbsp; That's a pretty hefty bill&nbsp;no matter where.&nbsp; Circe always reminded me of Uncle Iroh from Avatar: The Last Airbender.&nbsp; Full of the wisdom that makes other people slap their own heads.&nbsp; But what a wonderful way to make all of us re-read the entire comic!&nbsp; Sometime I wonder if JGrey is evil or just love to torture us.<br><br>
