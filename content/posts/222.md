Today, I decided to post the comments after the comic itself was posted instead of the other way around.<br><br>We're coming up on the end of this storyline. The next one will have more action. Also? Shopping.<br>

<br> So no accidental falling or pushing off the cliff, and yes, Theresa DOES feel better now. And for you, Chrys. Quest complete.<br>

<br> The backgrounds on panels 2 &amp; 3 are breathtaking ... the colours are amazing.
