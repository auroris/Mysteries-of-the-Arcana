<p>Theresa was feeling a little blue about missing the holidays back home so Chrys decided to cheer her up!</p><p>I don't think Chrys quite gets Thanksgiving.</p><p>Speaking of which!</p><p>When I mentioned, last week, that we would have one story update this week I completely spaced on the fact that this is the Thanksgiving holiday week. Which means, instead, you all get this lovely filler Keith made.</p><p>Story comics resume next week!</p>
