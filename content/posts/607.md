<p>Hopefully things are back on track now. I had intended to have this up earlier today but, unfortunately, I was having troubles accessing the site. All seems to be okay now.</p><p>As some of you know, I write RPG stuff as a side job. Flaming Crab Games, a small publisher I work for, is holding a Kickstarter to fund a monthly line of books titled "Letters from the Flaming Crab". Each month, we explore a different topic and try to examine ideas that are underserved, underdeveloped, or just plain neat.</p><p>The line is my brainchild and I develop, edit, and co-write each book. Presently, we're trying to raise $2,500 and we're just about halfway there. Without this Kickstarter, we're probably not going to be able to continue the line past the books already in development. If you're interested, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1456806822/letters-from-the-flaming-crab-2016-for-the-pathfin" target="_blank">please go take a look at the Kickstarter</a>. Donate if you can. Tell friends who are fellow roleplayers.</p><p>Thanks! See you Monday!</p>
