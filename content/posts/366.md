I've counted up the votes! I want to thank everyone who participated. Here are the results:<br><br>Black: 2 votes<br>Blue: 3 votes<br>Green (hunter or forest): 3 votes<br>Red: 3 votes<br>Purple: 4 votes<br><br>So! Purple wins. Which, to me, is funny. Why? When I design a character for Mysteries of the Arcana I put a lot of thought into symbolic references. That's the nature of a tarot based comic. To that end, every character is assigned a signature color. Blue's is Blue. William's is white. Theresa's is hunter/forest green. And purple? Purple belongs to Chrys.<br><br>So, Theresa will be wearing Chrys's signature color! How neat is that?<br><br>There's gonna be a big announcement with the next comic. Stay tuned!<br>

<br> I like Mandrake's little "innocent whistling".
