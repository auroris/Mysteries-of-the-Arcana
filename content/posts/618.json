I thought about this whole situation, and Theresa's issue with firing her pistol, when I wrote this chapter.

And we're getting some commissioned art even. I was kinda hoping at the start that we'd make it until colour illustrations, but actually got afraid we'd not make it at all midway through, when the numbers just didn't seem to rise anymore. So mostly I'm just happy and eagerly awaiting the letters, including my captained month of May. :D"

Theresa, what you're seeing is already missing a quarter of their head and half their brain to go with it, shooting them would be a mercy because whatever life that's available from that ain't worth living.Last edited by Guest<br>Edited 1 time(s)."
