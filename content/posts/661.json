It gives two characters who have only had a handful of panels a central role in their own story.</p><p>2. It returns to a location we've previously visited as a comic.</p><p>3. It provides more insight into an important plot point and an even which was mentioned in chapter 6.</p><p>4. It has the longest and most kick-ass action sequence the comic has had yet. Not GrrlPower super power brawl in the parking lot long but long.</p><p>I'm looking forward to sharing it with you all!</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>",
