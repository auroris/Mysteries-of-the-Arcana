She's also in a rather unfashionable (but comfy) bathrobe. Or dressing gown, if you prefer. Theresa looks like she slept in her clothing. Maybe she has.</p><p>Theresa's got a breakfast burrito on her plate. Chrys has toast and a glass of juice squeezed from a fruit that doesn't exist on our world.</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>",
