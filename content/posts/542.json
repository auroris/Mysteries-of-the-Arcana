I'm looking forward to that and I hope you are as well! I'm thinking of moving Bricks of the Arcana to a separate section of the site where it will continue to update. It probably shouldn't be in the main archive the way it is. I'll have more information as I ponder it out.</p><p>By the way, the present age of Chrys and Theresa is 17. Just putting that out there.</p>",
