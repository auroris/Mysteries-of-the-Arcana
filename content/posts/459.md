<br> &nbsp;Agree with Adamas, there. &nbsp;Understood it because I saw it happen. XD

<br> Well it's easy because we know what Mandrake is talking about! <br><br>You should give us an example sometime when we don't!<br>

<br> It all seems clear in hindsight. The 'chasing' icon with the stick figures is kinda cheating, but I don't see and alternative. Abstractions are tough with pictograms. How do her wings work with her outfit? Dosen't she need backless fashion?<br>

<br> I like the inset "Uh..." look in the third panel. I'd hate to see her prepare and give a speech.<br>
