Theresa needs to sort through things aloud and she needs Chrys to hear them. Poor Chrys doesn't have a frame of reference. She didn't grow up in the bible belt or, for that matter, the United States or even on Earth. She grew up in an interdimensional Inn where pretty much anything goes. That makes understanding harder for her. But not impossible.</p><p>So, this talk is overdue.</p><p>I'm still figuring out how I'm going to reconfigure the Patreon (I'm making some changes to it) but I'll let everyone know what's up with it when I'm done.</p><p>See you Monday</p>",
