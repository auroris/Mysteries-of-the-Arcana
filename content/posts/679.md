<p><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;"></span><em><strong><span style="font-family: Comic Sans MS;">Sorry!</span></strong></em></p><p>This site and a couple others on the network were being attacked by Chinese hackers, and I've been working to stop that for the past several weeks now.  There have been a couple of times the site was unavailable, and at least once when it was replaced with a Chinese news page. </p><p>So, after doing a revamp of most of the system that makes these sites tick, I believe I've managed to close the loophole the attackers were exploiting.  I also managed to break J's ability to upload a new comic. Oops.  Please forgive me, I think it's been corrected now and you can return to your regularly scheduled programming.</p>

<br> I'd love to do a code audit. <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">

<br> Hey - if even the owner can't access it, it must be secure against hackers, too, right?
