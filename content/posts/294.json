I enjoy artwork, yes... but far more, I enjoy story and concept. I do not mean to demean the work done by any artists in saying that... all I am saying is that I loved the comic from the first time I started reading it, because the story and universe have a unique feel, something that I am always interested in. I'll be sticking around as a reader so long as you keep updating; best wishes to you and those who work with you now and in the future <img src=\"//smilies/smile.gif\" alt=\"Smile\" border=\"0\">"

If Sarrah, who sounds like a professional, could honestly post&nbsp;the comment that she did above, then&nbsp;I say you were doing alright as a&nbsp;boss. On a side note, a true professional would never have burnt the bridges that Jessica did as she quit. You might&nbsp;honestly be better off with someone else.That said, please be careful. The artwork seems to be evolving into Order of The Stick. Just saying...&nbsp;"
