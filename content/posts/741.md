<p>Seems Mandrake made it back...albeit...she also seems to be having some issues being fully corporeal. We'll likely see more of how this cracked crystal impacts her very soon.</p><p>I'd like to thank you all for bearing with us lately, there's been a ton of life stuff on both mine and J's ends, and hopefully we'll be able to get back to regular updates incredibly soon!</p>
