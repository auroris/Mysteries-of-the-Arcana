<p>And here we go! Chrys picked the Hanged Man. Why? We'll find out next week!</p><p>Just a reminder that we'll be going to two story updates a week later this month. I'm looking forward to that and I hope you are as well! I'm thinking of moving Bricks of the Arcana to a separate section of the site where it will continue to update. It probably shouldn't be in the main archive the way it is. I'll have more information as I ponder it out.</p><p>By the way, the present age of Chrys and Theresa is 17. Just putting that out there.</p>

<br> Ahhh, the Hanged Man, such a beautiful Arcana, as long as you remember to pack a plasma cannon for the "mosquitos".<br>

<br> I'm suspecting a monestary or some other place of introspection coming up.
