We're seriously discussing putting together a \"dictionary\" to share with the readers at this point. There's been enough Mandrake speak to fill a page or two.</p><p>Also, introducing the castle of rain! Always under a cloud.</p><p>Be our guest when we return on Monday!</p>",

If Mandrake goes to the castle and kisses the beast before the last petal falls from the rose, than the spell is broken and wolfy reverts back to a boy.<br>That's what I'm getting from the bubbles, anyway."
