<p>Sorry for the delay guys and gals! We're back up and running, with a bit of a montage/collage of Theresa's birthday festivities...and I guess everyone was so excited, they never let her get her shower, or change her clothes.</p><p>I wonder what she has in all those lovely giftie boxes.</p><p>Also, Mandrake swimming in candy, so much fun, lol.</p>

<br> Was wondering what Mandrake was swimming in. Wasn't sure if it was jelly beans, confetti or just REALLY tiny balloons.<img src=" /smilies/balloons.gif " alt=" Ballons " vspace="2" hspace="2" border="0"><br>
