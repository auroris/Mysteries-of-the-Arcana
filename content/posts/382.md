Greetings, boys and girls and others; Keith W. here. You guys might remember me as that one guy who drew the first 2 chapters and such.<div><br></div><div>I realize, with everything going as it has been, there are a lot of questions, though two big ones seem to be in the forefront. We will answer those in this post.</div><div><br></div><div>Firstly, and most importantly, is J okay?</div><div><br></div><div>The short answer is yes. Which leads us to the second question.</div><div><br></div><div>Is MotA dead?</div><div><br></div><div>No. MotA is alive, and J still plans to continue it. Referring back to the first question; J's suffering pretty bad burnout. The best and biggest thing I think any of us can do is be supportive and understanding. He's been pushing this coming out for over 3 years, with nearly no failings to get the writing done.</div><div><br></div><div>Once he's able to find his footing, the comic will continue, and I sincerely hope all of you guys are here, ready for that to happen.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for your time, and stick around, I'm pretty darn sure much more exciting things are coming.</div><div><br></div><div>P.S.</div><div>The picture above...it was tons of fun to revisit characters I helped bring to life, and incorporate a few of the more recent stylized changes (Theresa's hair).</div><div><br></div><div>Hope you enjoyed!</div><div><br></div><div>Regards,</div><div>Keith W.</div>

<br> Glad to hear that this is not died. I started reading this comic the day the last page was posted and have bean coming back every now and then hoping for an update. I just want you to know that I believe that this comic was worth waiting around for even if I have only just found it.<br>

<br> I, too, am glad to hear that nothing seriously (physically) bad has happened to you, J, and will keep watching for updates. &nbsp;I look forward to the continuation once you are ready to do so.

<br>Glad nothing's wronger than writer's block/burnout.<br>I waited close to two years (as i recall) for "The Wotch" to restart, so i can wait a bit longer here, especially since i know that there are plans to continue.

<br> Great to see that J (and by extension, MotA) is alive. It was a pain in the backside not knowing what was going on IRL (seriously, not even a blog post...), but knowing that he is well is satisfying enough.<br><br>Us readers would understand <i>if you let us know about it</i>. I am a follower of another webcomic that is going through a similar hiatus (personal reasons cited), but the author posts the occasional blog to let us know that he is well.<br><br>Well, anyway J. Now that my rant is over, I just want you to know that we are still behind you 100%. You take your time to get yourself in the right mindset to continue with this amazing story.<br><br>Thanks for the update as well, Keith. Great to see you out and about again (or at least online <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"> )<br>

<br> Knowing what is going on is really helpful! I'm sorry that things are being rough on you J, but I'm really glad nothing worse is going on. I was getting really worried you died in a car crash or something. You have an interesting story and I am patient. You do what you need to do to take care of yourself, but please keep us in the loop this time.<br>Best wishes, Fay.<br>

<br> Not a problem. Im not a long time fan but i fell in love with arcana almost instantly. The only thing I ask is that you get better but take as long as you want for rest, true fans will always wait.
