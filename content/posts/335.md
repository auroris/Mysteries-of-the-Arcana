I think the purple stripes in Chrys's hair have been forgotten by every artist now. Its like a right of passage. Keith forgot them once or twice. I believe Sarrah and Jessica did, too. Now, Gennifer did.<br><br>So, yay! Gennifer is now all official as an artist!<br><br>There's a lot of exposition coming up, folks. This will be a very wordy sequence but pay attention. We're revealing something important.<br>

<br> I hope this next one won't be as bad as the last ones. Also, if Melody's hair is red, why does Chrys have purple highlights? Hair dye? *curious*
