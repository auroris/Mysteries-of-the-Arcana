I try to make the pictures give the meaning of what she's saying without it being a rebus.<br><br>Last page, she was saying 'I'm holding on tight!', a snarky response to Chrys's Han Solo style admonishment to hold on!<br><br>Today I got a little creative with Mandrake's pictographs. Can you figure out what she means?<br><br>Thursday, we have some special guest stars in Mysteries of the Arcana!",
