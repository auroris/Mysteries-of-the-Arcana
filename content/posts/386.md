Keith's hard at work doing the art for the rest of chapter four. We're also working on turning chapters one, two, and three into ecomics for sale. Up above are the roughs for a new chapter one cover. We've got Theresa, a Biohunter, William, and Chrys.<div><br></div><div>The script for chapter five is progressing nicely. I'm currently doing scene breakdowns.</div><div><br></div><div>I apologize for the wait on the rest of chapter four. We want to make sure we have a large buffer so there's no delay once we start posting it.</div><div><br></div><div>In the meanwhile, as many of you know, we're probably going to do a Kickstarter to fund chapter five. So, I've got questions - what sort of rewards would you like to see in an MotA kickstarter?</div>

<br> Hmm, maybe a hard copy Arcana reference booklet. Something that shows various Arcanas, their known traits and associated cards. Strengths and weaknesses, that sort of thing.<br><br>Hey, you know, you could potentially make an Arcana trading card game. Kickstart that? <img alt=" ThumbsUp " src=" //smilies/thumbsup.gif " border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2"><br>

<br> If you want to see what really creative rewards and stretch goals one comic artist did you can check out: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/alexwoolfson/the-young-protectors-vol-1-0 <br>You can also check out what he said about what he learned about kickstarters:http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/06/10/how-to-succeed-at-kickstarter/<br>Another tactic that I've seen used to help fund the art is having a page that goes up once a week regularly and then a day that one will go up every time the donation bar gets to a certain level. <br>Or sometimes people sell the original art for the comic to fans (or use it as a reward).<br>

<br> I highly recommend letting the backers vote on the content of rewards (who will be featured in some bonus art, like wallpapers that everyone who donates gets). It gets people so excited and involved. It's lots of fun and you know people are going to like what they get. To add variety to that (which some people crave, because usually the 2 or 3 favorite characters win everything), having one bonus art piece that is only for side characters, or characters who have not yet been in bonus art can really help make sure everyone is happy.<br>

<br> Also, if you are worried about asking too much from the artist for the kickstarter, you can go the route of writing a short story about the characters and putting in just a few pictures.<br><br>Non-cannon bonus material that is humorous can also be a lot of fun.<br>

<br> I was just wondering if the coloring on page 187, 188, 264 and 265 would ever be done and if the color on Theresas dress would ever be fixed on page 388-392?

the four black and white pages will be colored, yes. I have the originals, since I was the artist at the time. Not sure what J's got planned for the dress color thing.<br><br>

<br> Another thing you can do is offer printed and signed copies of the Tarot cards we've seen (and even those we haven't) to backers only.
