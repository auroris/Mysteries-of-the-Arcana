A few hours after I sent Keith the script for this page he IM'd me and asked if he could replace the talking heads in the middle panels with some of his own devising. I said sure! As a result, I have no idea who these people are or what their story is. He'll have to tell you.<br><br>The last two, however, are a pretty obvious homage to a man who can be a brilliant film writer but a sometimes moderate comic writer. Guess who!<br>

<br> Spoiler - It's the Cups universes' version of Jay and Silent Bob, of Clerks fame. If you've never seen the original, you should.<br>

Panel 2 is Aleena, she's an avid fan of the comic, and leader of the Space Elves (http://www.space-elves.com)<br><br>

Sorry, Hogan. He's someone we made up for the comic. No crossovers here for you to list. :(<br><br><br>
