<p><strong>Hidden Name</strong>: Jamey</p><hr><p>Honestly, that is just the cutest bucket of zombie body parts ever! :)</p><p>We're coming up on the close of chapter 5. When we finish up we'll be taking a break until the new year. We will be providing some neat filler, though, to bridge the gap between chapters 5 and 6. </p><p>I'll have an announcement by next Monday about chapter 6 as well. I've decided I won't be running a Kickstarter to fund it but there will be a funding drive of some kind.</p><p>In the meanwhile, please enjoy the rest of chapter 5!</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>
