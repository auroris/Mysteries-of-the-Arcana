When writing this sequence I considered a few pages of William trading blows with the horrors. However, I'd already written the sequence where William had trouble with just one horror. It didn't make sense for him to do so much better with 664 of them. William is faster, stronger, and tougher than a human being. The horrors are all faster, stronger, and tougher than him.<br><br>Still, he's fighting smart. Does anyone remember what happened the last time he pressed that button?<br>

<br> Poor William. The horrors have punched him so hard that his ears have switched places in panel 6. <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br><br>Awesome page, can�t wait to see another !GNAB.<br>I wonder, though, didn�t you say sometime that he can only press that button once a day or something like that?<br>He must then be able to get the black hole to swallow multiple enemies at once. Otherwise he�s still up against 663 horrors, and that aint much of a fight. <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br>

<br> <span style="font-family: Verdana;">That's once per <span style="font-style: italic;">combat</span>.&nbsp; Since he hasn't pushed that button since coming to his world, it counts... and we see a !GNAB part deux.&nbsp; <img alt=" Wink " src="%20/smilies/wink1.gif%20" border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2"><br></span>

<br> �<br><br>Now that's weird... why didn't the smiley work?<br>

**JD (Guest)** (2011-10-21)

<br> So sorry... the smiley didn't work because on new browsers, for some reason, it's inserting an extra space in the smiley code.&nbsp; It is being worked on, but first, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Black Hole</span> time!<br>

<br>In anticipation I just watched Soundgarden's Black Hole Sun video:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mbBbFH9fAg<br>Which made me wonder if this 'black hole and horrors' thing was inspired by that video.

<br> Oh, William, starting the fight with them beating you up first. Is this part of code of chivilery or something to not strike first in battle?<br>

<br> Nope it's called letting your foes get close enough to be sucked into an endlessly hungry abyss from which there is no escape. <img src="/smilies/wink1.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"><br>

<br> so can someone link the comic where we last saw the button-press? I totally do not remember it.
