We don't have the stamina of our neighbors up in Canada, it seems. </p><p>Apparently, the same is true of viquirrels. Chrys knows never to underestimate the sleepiness of a viquirrel. It seems she hasn't counted on how handsy Mister Mist is, though.</p><p><a href=\"http://drivethrurpg.com/product/162986/Sidebar-10--Equipment-Tricks-for-Rope\" target=\"_blank\">And I've got another Pathfinder-compatible product out.</a> This one's a simple $1, tiny bit of a thing. Just an upgrade of the Equipment Trick: Rope feat. Just thought I'd let y'all know.</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>",
