Okay! Jess tells me she still has shading to do on this page but we both thought you'd like to get a look at what happens next.<br><br>Mandrake speak is, and I have mentioned this before, hard to write. I have developed some standard pictograms she uses to mean certain things. The red circle with a slash through it, for example, usually means 'no'. She uses people's faces instead of 'you' or 'me'&nbsp; because that is easier to depict, with pictures, than pronouns. Likewise, certain concepts such as 'more' are hard to depict so I often leave the off and let people fill in the blanks. So, in the last panel of the previous page, Mandrake is saying:<br><br>No more of your games! No more of your plans!<br><br>It seems Mandrake's gotten tired of Chrys's manipulations, too.<br>

<br> From what I can figure out, today she's saying "You sold me out!" and "ARGGH!"<br>Hope this helped.<br>

<br> Mandrake gave Chrys the notorious "three snaps". =o<br>

<br> More like "You SOLD me!" Natalie. But close enough.<img alt=" Wink " src="//smilies/wink1.gif" border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2"><br><br>Yeah, I think Mandrake's reached her limit of "Your the bait"<br>

<br> Why donï¿½t you just use "&gt;" and "&lt;" for more and less?<br>

---
**Natalie (Guest)** (2011-06-21)

<br> @adamas oh, yeah, that makes more sense. XD<br><br>@Gunsolo cause it's not that obvious. I don't know which one's more and which one's less!<br>

<br> Righto... but I'll bet Mandrake isn't a programmer, and may not even be a math wiz.&nbsp; Technically those symbols represent 'greater than' and 'lesser than', so they don't translate well to saying something like "no more!"<br>

<br>Particularly not since those signs are used today on the net, but meaning "better than" rather than "more than". At least the way I interpret what people write.Seems like I missed the previous update, so I had to go back a page to actually see the lines that Mandrake said. It was a bit confusing, because I didn't see how those three snaps with her fingers were supposed to be interpreted as "no more games" and such.

<br> @Gillsing @TC technically, it's the notorious four snaps, since she snaps four times.<br>

<br> I figured three snaps officially, since she did the Z pattern.&nbsp; I took it that the original snap was used to started the technique, or whatever, with the following three snaps being the actual formation.<br>
