She can't see a gun without wanting to get her hands on it...</p><p>More seriously, when I was writing this chapter Keith and I had a lot of back and forth discussion on what sort of firearms the viquirrels would be carrying. We tried to stay in the WWI era in terms of what rifles we'd model from and, in the end, picked something Keith could work with. I'm glad his knowledge of firearms is so much more comprehensive than mine.</p><p>Has anyone read Jim Butcher's new book yet? I've got it on hold at the library but I'm 18th in line for it. I don't expect to read it until sometime in November.</p>",

At least not completely."
