<p>I managed to post a page! </p><p>For those people who back the Patreon: Today's page has a small difference from the preview I posted last night. Can you find it?</p><p>So, let me explain why Keith's been posting the pages lately. There is, unfortunately, cancer in my immediate family. That means chemo and doctor's appointments and more household responsibilities on my end. Which means more stress and less time for activities like posting comics. Keith's been an amazing help in making sure things keep going.</p><p>We'll see everyone on Monday. Enjoy your weekend!</p>

<br> Such sad news but hope it will all turn out fine for your family member.
<br>And do remember that you won't help anyone if you wear yourself out too much so remember to get some rest as well.

<br> I really hope it got caught in time, J. My family wasn't so lucky. Nearly two years on and my heart still cries due to the fact my grandma's gone. She was only 79...

<br> Melt the rest of that button head! She needs to eliminate Mist-Eerie right off, 'cuz shooting at nothing likely won't get very far.
