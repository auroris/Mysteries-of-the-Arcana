<p>Christmas is coming but the squirrels aren't getting fat...</p><p>SO THEY ARE AT WAR!</p><p>War.</p><p>War never changes.</p><p>Ahem! Well, that was certainly random.</p><p>Speaking of Christmas, there are two ways you can give a Christmas present to the team behind your favorite webcomic (no, not that one. Mysteries of the Arcana, silly!)</p><p>First, up until the end of the month, for every commission Keith gets from a Mysteries of the Arcana reader, I will be paying him an additional $1. So, feel free to go to <a href="/commissionkeith" target="_blank">Keith's commission page</a> and find out his very reasonable rates!</p><p>And, of course, you can <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=452395" target="_blank">support our Patreon</a>. The Patreon pays for the comic. Without it, the comic wouldn't be here. I mean this quite sincerely. We are currently $31 away from our next milestone, at which point I start paying myself a whole $5 per page! We're $61 away from the milestone after that, where Keith gets a raise!  So, please consider supporting us!</p><p>Thank you and see you Monday.</p>

People have a knack for being rotten.<br>How?&nbsp; A php vulnerability on the host server. This is being patched.<br><br>So... there ya go.<br><br><br>
