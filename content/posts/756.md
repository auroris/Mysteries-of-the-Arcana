<p>Seems that Theresa was rather caught off-guard by the gown on Chrys' body. And it also seems their time is up on their outing. Next week should wrap up my little short story of mine, and hopefully you guys are still enjoying the ride along with me.</p><p>There are still a few more little surprises in this, that I hope I can fit into two pages. Thanks for hanging through with us!</p>

<br> I just glanced at the page again - the panel showing Chrys from the back - is she planning to start up a formal plumbing service?<br><br>Because if so that backline is certainly appropriate...<br>
