  "text": "Hello everyone!<br><br>Just a note to keep everyone up to date. I'm waiting on one more audition page. One way or the other, I'll be making a decision Friday. After that comes discussion with the artist I've chosen. Hopefully, we'll be up and running again soon after that.<br><br>I did not get any auditions that looked like Keith or Sarrah's work. Whoever fills the shoes, their style will be different from the majority of MotA thus far. I am trying hard to pick an artistic style that works well for the story.",

They didn't pay me, but I was happy with the job for about a month, before the artist change and then I stopped receiving the pages that needed the spell corrections (that was my job). The texts suffers for it even more then usual."

I'm no fink.)"
