       Hello, everyone. Its J. Not sure who is still reading this, especially since Google Reader shut down and I'm sure that screwed with RSS feeds but here's a status update. I'm going to break it down into two parts. First, what happened. Second, what's going to happen.<div><br></div><div><b>What happened</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>I could go into a long and complex explanation about insecurities and depressions but that would be whining and complaining. The truth is, I punked out and I got scared and it was just easier to pretend the comic didn't exist than deal with my inner demons.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I'm sorry about that. The readers of Mysteries of the Arcana, who supported the comic through thick and thin, deserved better than I gave them.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What's going to happen</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>What's going to happen is the comic is returning. We're going to finish out this chapter and continue. Gennifer has, since our last page, become something of a hotshot in the RPG art world. Seriously. Go to RPGnow.com or Drive Thru RPG and enter Gennifer Bone in the search field and a ton of books will pop up! She's got some serious art chops going and a lot on her plate in terms of work. Because of that, I've had to search for a new artist. Luckily, Keith W just happened to have a hole in his schedule that needed filling.</div><div><br></div><div>That's right. The original artist of MotA is coming back to help out. He's been very gracious about agreeing to "return to his roots". I'm thrilled to be working with him again.</div><div><br></div><div>I'm in the process of writing and rewriting. Then he'll begin drawing. We're going to try to get some pages under our belt and build up a buffer before we begin posting so please bear with us for a few more weeks. It might not be until the beginning of November before we are ready to go.</div><div><br></div><div>But we WILL be ready to go.</div><div><br></div><div>In the meanwhile, we'll post a few updates. Examples of art. Things to show we're alive and not flaking out again.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Also, and I hate to do this without real proof that the comic is back, but art isn't cheap. Keith's being very nice about working with a down payment and a promise of full rates ($20 a page) down the line. Once we have this chapter done, we're going to try a Kickstarter to raise operating capital and maybe even get a print edition. Until that time, if anyone can see it in their heart to donate funds, we'd appreciate it. That will help make sure Keith has art supplies and food. However, given the long hiatus the comic had, if you want to wait until there is proof that the comic is coming back? We understand that. The important thing is that you come and read Mysteries of the Arcana when it returns.</div><div><br></div><div>I promise, the story will continue.</div>

<p class="comment_text"> </p><p class="comment_text"><span class="forum_info">Guest post by "Drachefly"</span><br> What a coincidence! I read to the end of the archive last year, noted it was on hiatus, and left.
<br>
<br>Two days ago, I remembered this comic and wondered what happened to it. Yesterday I found it and thought, "Aww, still on hiatus? Too bad" but I signed up for it on comic-rocket just in case... and then today you say it's coming back.
<br>
<br>Wow!</p>

<p class="comment_text"> </p><p class="comment_text"><span class="forum_info">Guest post by "WW"</span><br> Hey, great to see the comic returning! I don't remember when I started reading, but I've been here for some time. I've just never commented anything.<br><br>I actually stopped reading few pages before the hiatus in order to build a buffer, so I never even knew about it before this summer when I suddenly started thinking about "that tarot comic". But because I'm terrible when it comes to names, I just couldn't remember the name. The closest I got was Realms of Arkania, but that turned out to be a DOS game I tried out once.<br><br>I tried pretty much every variation of "tarot centered webcomic" on Google search and even dug through an entire webcomic review website, but nothing turned up. I was kinda terrified.<br><br>As a last resort I turned to the character names, but all I could remember at first was Blue, which wasn't very helpful. Then as I dug through my memories I remembered William and Chrys. I finally found MotA again when I googled "william chrys elf" which brought me it's a TV Tropes article, only to find out the hiatus. It was quite an adventure.<img alt=" Smile " src="/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2"><br><br>I really have no idea how I even could forget the name. MotA is one of my favourite webcomics.<br></p>

I knew you had to find what you were looking for first. Welcome back!<br><br>A warm merry meet to keith as well. I look forward to your guys awesome work/story.<br><br>I would defintely support a kickstarter of this.(once I get the funds ofc.) If you could convince keith to draw some MoTa tarot cards...I would totally buy those as well.(just an idea)<br><br>welcome back again. May your spirit be one with the spirits around you.<br></p>

<p class="comment_text"> </p><p class="comment_text"><span class="forum_info">Guest post by "Osk"</span><br> Checking here once each month, sometimes twice, has finally paid off! It's one of the more interesting concepts I've encountered so far and worth waiting for. Then again, I can't wait to see the story continue, though as mentioned before, if I can wait untill now, I can wait another few weeks, months, but I make no promises about years.</p>
