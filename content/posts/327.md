I fully expect some readers to cry foul over this one.<br><br>Why? I'm not going to advertise. If you don't figure it out I'm quite happy. If you do, then I'll be glad to explain why it isn't as bad as it seems. :)<br><br>Some badass William coming later this week!<br>

<br> Interesting solution. <br>

<br> Yeah, jump starting a truck with a taser isn't too likely, plenty of volts but not enough amps.&nbsp; What the hell though, it's in another universe, physics could be completely whack there.&nbsp; I'll continue to suspend disbelief.<br>

<br> I'm with JD on this. Plus using raw water will cause battery failure ... but it's not really important right now I guess ^^<br>Also I adore your story, so I'm not saying this suck or anything, I love the way you write and this is a great arc.<br>

<br> LOL, saw the name brand on the battery! <img src="//smilies/wink1.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"> One thing Theresa forgot. GAS! It's probably all evaporated by now.<br>

<br> Yeah, if the truck runs on gasoline it would have turned to high octane varnish by now.&nbsp; But again, different universe... The truck could run on liquid propane, or cockroach farts for all we know.<br>

<br> I figure that if you can jump start a car using a device that is nothing more than a really large number of AA batteries taped together, then why not jump start a vehicle using a taser.<br>

<br> Someone should tell Mythbusters about this, this would be a good one.<br>

Clever, Adamas. That is, indeed, not a taser from the Hierophant (aka our Earth). The water is plain old water, though. I admit its bad for the battery.<br><br><br>
