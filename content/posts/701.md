<p>Thanks for the all the well-wishes, everyone! And thank you, Keith, for redoing the entire page after I remembered I had forgotten to tell him, 'Do this one in color'.</p><p>And so we learn the Arcana of the animated objects and Mr. Fuzzy is, in fact, in permanent black and white and the coloration was not the result of a flash back.</p><p>Next page is the last page of this storyline and then we move onto, "Birthday", the last short story of this chapter.</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>

<br> There is a web comic called "Unicorn Jelly" about people in a different universe than our own.&nbsp; That universe (its name is "Tryslmaistan") has&nbsp; different physical laws; things aren't made out of atoms, they are made out of "tratons"; there is no gravity, but there is a force called "linovection" that pulls things down (there is in fact an absolute "up" and absolute "down" in Tryslmaistan); etc.&nbsp; And the creator of the comic pointed out that to visit such a universe you need to become part of it... your body will now be made of tratons, and so on.&nbsp; (It's highly improbable that anyone would survive this!&nbsp; How can the chemical reactions in a human body work the same way when the chemistry is different due to different physical laws... heck, the equivalent of electricity in Tryslmaistan has *three* different charge states, positive, negative, and some third thing.)<br><br>The above was a slightly mind-bending thought when I first encountered it.&nbsp; But it makes total sense, and I buy it completely.&nbsp; To visit a different universe with different physical laws, you either need to be wrapped in some sort of protection that stubbornly holds a pocket of the laws of your own universe, or else you need to be "converted" somehow into the kind of matter that exists in that universe.<br><br>I'm going to guess that the inter-universe travel in Mysteries of the Arcana converts the travelers if need be.&nbsp; So these guys never had colors before, and now they do!<br>
