<p>So, over the weekend we were hacked. I don't understand all the details but apparently someone in France took advantage of a weakness in the site's host to put in redirects and junk that led to a Chinese news site.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Couldn't tell you.</p><p>But JD got things working right away so let's hear it for the man of the hour! Hooray JD!</p><p>There will be no comic on Thursday since it is the American holiday we like to call...</p><p>... eat a lot day.</p>

<br> Well, Mister Eerie lives up to his name. His head doesn't look too firmly attached to his body, I wonder what would happen if it got removed.

<br> .... So Mr.Grumpy and Mr.Happy are using locals to settle a feud or are the two pin heads the same guy with different heads.

<br> Happy turkey day! <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br><br>I wonder if Mr. Mist and Mr. Eerie are the same person with different pin-masks and bow-ties. <br>I'm thinking that mostly because they look so similar and because <a name="" target="" classname="" class="" href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/comics/590/">the triple signpost said</a> there <b>was an</b> outsider. Singular, not plural. <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br>
