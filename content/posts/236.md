I wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who has helped Mysteries of the Arcana grow. If you've linked us on your blog (faeteardrop), added us to your bookmark/link page (felix), retweeted us (Adam), recommended us to your readers (thereisnosaurus), or mentioned us on another comic's comment page (fairportfan)... thank you. <br><br>Please, continue to do so. The more exposure the comic gets the better. I won't lie. We want a lot of readers.<br><br>Thank you!<br>
