What's going to happen next to poor Mandake!</p><p>I spent this weekend thinking of the great animated superhero shows that have been produced since the 90s. The DCAU shows, for example: Batman, Superman, Static, Zeta, Justice League and Justice League Unlimited. There was also Teen Titans. I really enjoyed Batman: Brave and the Bold, too. On the Marvel side I had a lot of fun with Spectacular Spider-Man and Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes. The latest crop of Marvel shows aren't quite as good but are growing on me.</p><p>What about you? Any superhero shows you enjoyed?</p>",

They're pretty good. I also saw a few Avengers episodes, but they weren't as interesting.<br><br>On the other hand, I've also seen the entire first season of Arrow and the first ten episodes of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and I think those are really good."
