Hello, everyone! Fantastic news! I have been fortunate enough to hire a pitch hitter for Keith. Starting Monday, Mysteries of the Arcana will be illustrated by Sarrah of the <a name="" target="_blank" classname="" class="" href="http://www.eldlor.com/">Planes of Eldlor</a>, a wonderful fantasy webcomic and fellow SpiderForest member. So, hold on until next Monday and we'll have more dreamwalking goodness!<br>

<br> Oh thank the Fates that move the many worlds we walk upon....&nbsp; I don't have to help.<br><br>Sarrah's artwork and coloring is outstanding, I definitely look forward to seeing how she handles the Arcana. <br>
