<br> That was kinda silly for the fairy especially after the red head made a comment on hide and seek a little earlier. So my guess is that that one is a copy.<br>

<br> Heat vision, eh? <br>Easy enough to fool, you just need a puddle of mud. Right? <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br>

<br> Gunsolo: Erm... Yeah. Depending on Mandrake's speed vs the speed of the shot, she could survive, injured but still...<br>

<br> Since Mandrake is from a Magi-cyber Arcane, an Illusion spell from there might include a heat signature to fool Security cameras<br>
