However, he did tell me I could try my hand at a MotA short story.</p><p>This idea kind of percolated in my mind a bit before forming up. Interestingly, some elements are still in flux, so you guys are welcome to offer input and ideas, that might be reflected as this short story unfolds between the girls, and this christmas experience I want to share.</p><p>See you guys on Monday!</p>",
