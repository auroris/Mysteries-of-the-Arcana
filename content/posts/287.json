Jessica is the creator of <a name=\"\" target=\"_blank\" classname=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"http://www.lovefeast-comic.com/\">Lovefeast</a> and <a name=\"\" target=\"_blank\" classname=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"http://www.millennium-comic.com/\">Millennium</a>, two excellent webcomics. Her art and color work has always impressed me so I was pleased when she said she'd sign on with us. Jessica will be the artist of MotA at least through the end of this story.<br><br>Say hello, everyone!",

So I fully intend to give Jessica my support and praise. (I certainly couldn't draw so well.) I'm also looking forward to witnessing the resolution of these current storylines. Hooray for character development!"
