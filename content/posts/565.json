Does this comic deliver or does it deliver?</p><p>As many of you know, I'm a GM as well as a comic writer. I'm running a Pathfinder campaign set in a non-MotA setting and two of my players have asked for a second campaign to explore different characters in a different section of the setting. We need 1 to 2 more but are having trouble finding someone. We'll be playing every other week, 8:30 - 11:30(ish) Eastern Standard Time. The campaign will focus on exploration and adventure with a bit of an Indiana Jones vibe. If you're interested, let me know. </p><p>And for fun, here's something I already shared with the Patreon crowd.
