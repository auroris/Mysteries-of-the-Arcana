Chrys and Mandrake get to have some daring action instead of William and Mandrake.<br><br>In case you haven't noticed, I tend to write action a little quirky. I prefer my heroes to think outside the box and for the solution to be something other than a knock down, dragged out slug fest that lasts for months. Hopefully, you enjoy it!",

I think.  Going by memory here.  For exact references... Google!"
