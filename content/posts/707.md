<p>As a reminder, Theresa lives in a square room beneath the pub room of the Inn. The entrance/exit is via an old fashioned lift (of the sort built into sidewalks next to stores in some cities) which lifts her up to the pub room. It wouldn't pass a modern safety inspection but it does function.</p><p>Someone forgot to mention to Chrys that surprise parties are better held NOT first thing in the morning, I suspect...</p><p>See you Monday!</p>

<br> But holding it in the morning makes it that much more of a surprise!

<br> Woot! Happy Birthday Theresa!<br><br>Why not have it first thing? It starts the day out so much better, and she isn't spending the day thinking nobody cares.<br>
