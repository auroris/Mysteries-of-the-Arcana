<p>Some of you may recall, we did a preview image before chapter 6 started, hinting at this development. Also, if you go back, you'll notice that Theresa's hair gets a bit longer each chapter. See? We've got hair development AND character development here at Mysteries of the Arcana!</p><p>Honestly, I told Keith this was one of the best pages he's ever done. The action and colors are vivid and I think it really carries the emotions. What do you think? </p>

<br> Question, &nbsp; just want someone to confirm whether or no i'm reading this correct.

<br>I'm confused too. Why does he cut her hair? He says save yourself some pain, and then he cuts her hair, and it was such a spectacular grab to snatch all her hair in one snatch with no loose strands.Is her hair sensitive? Or is this leading up to something like grabbing her by the arm and snicking it off as well? That must be it. He's showing off his ability to slice through something substantial with just the flex of his fingers. Right. Right?

Consider how you react to pain. Sometimes you jerk, or spasm, or pull away.<br><br>

<br> Well, <i>I</i> am thinking that I've just read parts of the newest rulebook edition of the Das Schwarze Auge (the black eye) rpg. And there was a handicap you could buy for your character that links some of a mage's spiritual power with his hair. And if he loses part of it, he will also temporarily lose some of the power (though it regenerates as normal).<br>I wonder if it's the same with Chrys.<br>
