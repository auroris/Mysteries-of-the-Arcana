<p>Here in my neck of the woods it is officially winter. Snow's on the ground. I had to shovel the drive. We've got out oil heat on most nights instead of the electric heat. There's a Christmas tree set up and decorated.  There's been a snow day or two for the local schools.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mandrake's heading for the rainy castle, carried along against her will. Why isn't she trying to wiggle free, fight, or escape you might ask? That's just not her style. She's learned a lot since she was a young thief, stealing food in a cyberpunk fantasy land. Now she knows it is best to pick one's battles and wait for the right opportunity.</p><p>Plus, she's enjoying trolling this guy.</p><p>What's on your Christmas game list this year? There's a lot of great new LEGO Dimension sets out!</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>

<br> I would never buy lego dimensions for kids.&nbsp; Lego Mindstorms, lego technic, or basic lego sets yes.&nbsp; Let their imaginations do the work rather than the imaginations of the movie producers.<br>

<br> *grumbles*&nbsp; "Grrrrr... Mandrake <i>WILL</i> kiss Woof before the last petal falls and break the spell so rain will turn Woof back into boy."<br><br>Mandrake - "La la la la I can't hear you..."<br><br>heh<br>

<br> Aw, she comes with backing music now! *l*<br><br>My game list is entirely low-tech this year. Despite having owned an X-Bone for the better part of a year, there's only two discy games I've given any care about for it and I have those already. (Rock Band 4 and Deadpool, btw.) And I done bought Pokï¿½Moon as well.<br>
