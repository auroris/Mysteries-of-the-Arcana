NOTE: Sorry, readers. I suspect that Keith's been hit by the weather and, so, the comic is delayed.<br><br>I'm getting very, very tired of moving snow. While having a small snowblower makes it sooooo much easier, I could stand to go a few weeks without clearing the drive and walkways. Or months.<br><br>And that snow blower doesn't help me dig out my mailbox so I can continue to get postal service.<br><br>Bleh.<br><br>Hope the weather's better where you are, dear reader.<br>

<br> Yup, working 150 km south of&nbsp; Ft. McMurray, and the weather is peachy.&nbsp; +5 to -15 and sunny; any warmer and the ice roads would start melting.<br>

<br> <font class="Apple-style-span" size="2">Of course it is, but then I'm in the one part of the Country that didn't get hammered by the snow: Florida. &nbsp;(It hit north of the Ocala National Forest.)</font>

<br> I live just about an hour north of Indianapolis, we got hit by the storm here too but it wasn't as bad as the one we had five years ago. That one completely shut the city down for a week and only some of the businesses were running on week 2, a couple of days is nothing.<br>

<br> <font size="3"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ever notice how it is "Snow, snow, beautiful snow" and "I'm dreaming of a White Christmas" until Christmas is over. The it's "Damn! I am so sick of this! When is Spring going to come? Come on Spring!"<br></span></font>

<br> I'm from a&nbsp;usually really&nbsp;snowy part of Canada... And we are getting nearly nothing this year. What you guys are getting more is what we are getting less, pretty much. I'm not complaining: You get to feel our pain for once! <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">

Biggest problem with where I live is one day it's 60 degrees, the next it's 7 degrees.&nbsp; The&nbsp;hot/cold rollercoaster wears down the body and makes it easy for us to get constantly sick.&nbsp; It's a relief when we do get snow so we can have a couple days off work to rest up.&nbsp;<br><br>
