The end of Chapter Three: Two by Two. This is the 293rd page. I could have stretched out the story for an even 300 pages but I didn't feel like being lynched.<br><br>Starting Thursday, we'll be taking a two week break from the comic. Don't despair, however! We will be doing a question and answer comic during that time period to give everyone more information about Mysteries of the Arcana.<br><br><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">To that end, we need questions! One very benevolent reader has given us several but I'd like some source variety. So, please, if you have a question about the arcana the characters, or some aspect of the story so far, please email it to mysteriesofthearcana (at) gmail (dot) com. Thank you!</span><br><br>In the meanwhile, today's comic is the PERFECT time for you to comment on the story section! My goal is to get at least twenty comments on this page that aren't posted by myself of Gennifer. Hop to it! :)",

My question is, how many of these different Arcana have we seen so far, and what cards are they named after?<br><br>I suppose the follow-up question to this would be do you know how many you're going to show us in the future, or do you not plan it out?"

No idea why tho. <br><br>Anyway...I got to say this is one of my favorite web comics. The art has always been great, the writing has never bugged me, or seemed dull, and oh god, I'm rambling. -.-*<br><br>I'll wrap up and say that although I have a few questions that I may email out (mostly cause I'm really too into figuring out the lore of these sort of stories), I am truly glad this comic has continued. And if I ever get my finances in order, and if you decide to publish this down the road, I'm buying. Oh crap, I rambled on again..."
