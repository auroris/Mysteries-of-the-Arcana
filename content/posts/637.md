<br>Does Chrys normally wear her belt under her butt?At first glimpse of that belt and her waistband, it looked as if we were a touch beyond the "first kiss" stage...===============Let me rephrase that: "...a bit beyond and several touches past..."

<br>Quite daring to kiss in front of that rainbow fire and smile without checking if they are truly dealt with first.&nbsp;Lovely page and a scene that would make for a great wallpaper.&nbsp;

<br> It is hard to tell which is hotter. Their blossoming romantic relationship, or the living embodiment of Fire (fire elemental?)<br><br>:P<br>

<br> I would suggest that the void monster, now that it has form of flame, is causing their passion to ignite. That magic bullet also created an aphrodisiac beast.<br>
