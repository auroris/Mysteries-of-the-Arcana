For those of you who aren't familiar with the amazing Simon and Garfunkle, today's title is a reference to one of the folk duo's best songs. I highly recommend you go give them a listen if you've never heard them before.<br><br>Also, can Keith paint a pretty sunset or what?<br>

<br>I can't say I know that song (or group), but yes it is a beautiful sunset <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">I did notice it in the previous page, but I kinda forgot to mention it in my comment, sorry!Well, this ended up as good as it could logically get... Theresa is probably going to stay bitter at Chrys for quite some time, but at least she's not going to do anything irreversible.&nbsp; So hopefully all she'll need is a bit of time and they'll be able to be friends (or more) again <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">
