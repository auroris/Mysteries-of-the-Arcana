One of the best parts of this storyline? I get to highlight that Theresa and William are, in a lot of ways, alike. They both have a warrior's mentality and a strong, tactical sense. And, as we'll point out later on, they're both willing to make command decisions without the consensus or even knowledge of others involved.<br><br>Of course, Mandrake and Chrys have a lot in common with each other, too. <br>

<br>Yay! I was mostly right! If I had just added the way of leaving the camp I'd be completely right! <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">With the acidity of regular ants and everything, I hope Theresa won't end up with a giant rash because she rode those! And let's hope those ants are well trained enough so that they don't attack her instead...I do agree that Theresa and William are alike in a lot of ways... Does this mean that we'll eventually have Theresa forget/change her orientation and that she'll end up going out with Dog Boy instead, leaving fans of Mysteries of the Arcana across the world boil in despair and frustration?

<br> First panel was hard to decipher.&nbsp; I can see it's Theresa's ankle, now replaced in her boot, but it took me a while.&nbsp; Perhaps if panel two were eliminated (we can see the gun on her hip in three) there would be room for more boots and feet, providing better context.<br>
