<p>Fairportfan, to answer your question: No, Chrys and Theresa aren't sharing a room. This is in a little closet area Kludge set up on the second floor of the Inn. It happens to be off the corridor between Chrys's room and the showers (very few of the rooms in the Inn have their own bathroom) so Chrys noticed Theresa inside when she passed by on her way back from her evening cleaning.</p><p>Theresa, meanwhile, is brooding. She broods even when she has no real reason to brood. She'd totally be Batman in another life.</p><p>Or maybe its angsting. </p><p>In which case she'd be Spider-Man.</p><p>See you Monday!</p>

<br> Or maybe she's angst-brooding. Which would make her Spider-Bat.

<br> Theresa's birthday came and went. We had cake and ice cream, and were accompanied by mechanical spiders and intelligent flies. For entertainment we chewed gum and made our own bounce house. It was a great time right up until the dog opened a black hole and sucked the life out of the party.<br>

<br> Love kludges reuse of the Antikythera mechanism here. Originally designed to reconcile several different timekeeping systems, adapted by him for use across arcana as well.<br>
