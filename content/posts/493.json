First, someone tried to hack the server where we're kept. Nothing was compromised or damaged but it took some time to remove the trojans implanted. Then, our domain name expired. Of course, since I registered it five years ago it took me time to find all the proper passwords and usernames and such in order to renew the registration. However, all that's in the past!</p><p>I'm really pleased to say that our Guest Villain, the mysterious hacker trying to find the Inn's secrets, is also one of the comic's biggest supporters. It is safe to say, without her, Mysteries of the Arcana wouldn't be here. Aleena, everyone! The elfiest elf who ever elfed!</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>",
