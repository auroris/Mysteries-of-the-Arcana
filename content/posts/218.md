It took a week longer than anticipated to get back online, but I've returned! The house is all moved into. There's electricity, internet, cable, phones, hot water, and oil heat. Everything works, more or less, and most of the stuff is unpacked. For the first time ever, all my RPG books are unpacked and on a shelf. In fact, for the first time ever, all my books are unpacked.<br><br>To celebrate the fact that I have room for all my books, I've ordered one of the new Kindles.<br><br>As for today's page... sometimes, completing the quest doesn't feel like victory. Sometimes, doing something good for yourself makes you feel like crap. <br>
