<br>Not only is the world flat, but it is turtle-shaped? Well, at least that world is <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">So we won't get epic cloak taming? Ah well...

<br> Actually zooming out farther and farther after a character is abandoned and collapses alone is a nice effective dramatic technique that reinforces feelings of alienation and separation, particularly when we don't see other people.
<br>It would have been a lot better if she'd been faintly visible in the first panel instead of zooming out too far for that, though.

<br><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US" lang="EN-US">Reminds me of Kiel from Drowtales&nbsp;: �Let me explain the universe I live in. Everything, the whole of the 3 worlds are upon a turtle. And that turtle is on a turtle. That turtle is on another turtle, and so forth all the way down to infinity.� And I think the joke comes from something Stephen Hawkins wrote � can�t remember it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, what is the deal with turtles and infinity? Despite it being infinitely hilarious?</span><span style="mso-ansi-language:EN-US" lang="EN-US">And that another great chapter by the way. It�s good Chrys didn�t get shoot ^^</span>
