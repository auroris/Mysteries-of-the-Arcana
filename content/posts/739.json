Or is this just a flesh wound?</p><p>Keep in mind, this was no small explosion. The shockwave was enough to smash the Beast's windshield which is a decent distance away from the Royal Road. </p><p>Now, I want to ask a question. I'd like it if as many people could comment on it as possible. A while back, I had the idea of using the vs. M RPG engine to create a <strong>Mysteries of the Arcana</strong> roleplaying game. It would be official, using art from the comic, and act not only as a game but as a lore guide for the multiverse presented in MotA.</p><p>Is this something you, as a regular reader of the comic would be interested in? Is it something you'd be interested in helping fund? RPGs based on small properties like this generally don't do well so I'd want to to be sure the desire for it to be out in the world was there.</p><p>Please let me know what you think.</p><p>See you Monday!</p>",
