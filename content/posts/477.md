<p><strong>Hidden Name</strong>: Snow by Night</p><hr>
<p>As Keith was coloring this page he IM'd me asking what color Chrys's magic should be here. It was blue the <a href="/comics/5/" target="_blank">first time</a> we saw her use this particular spell and purplish <a href="/comics/153/" target="_blank">the second time</a>. So, of course, I said red. The reason? </p><p>This particular spell allows you to make formula tweaks. A master of the magic can change the color of the spell, the sound it makes as it if cast, the shape of the energy ball and so forth. In other words, the spell can be customized to the user's preferences. Chrys, never a master of patience, didn't bother to learn more than the casting of the spell itself. As a result, the spell comes out a different color every time. She has no control over that particular variable.</p><p>Aren't you glad I stay up at night thinking of these things?</p><p>See you Monday!</p>
