Those are all worth a read. <br><br>The comic I want to recommend today, however, is a fellow fantasy adventure called Shadowbinders. Its about 150 pages in, far enough that it has a strong plotline established. The writing is tight and art beautiful to look at. I highly recommend it.<br><br><a name=\"\" target=\"_blank\" classname=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"http://shadowbinders.com/\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/pics/shadowbinders.jpg\" border=\"0\" hspace=\"\" vspace=\"\"></a>",
