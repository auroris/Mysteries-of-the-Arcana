J's been prepping for, and now snow attacked by this blizzard that's swept its way across Canada and the New England states of the US.</p><p>Hopefully we'll be able to stay up and on schedule during all this, but here's wishing J good luck with the shoveling and not throwing out his shoulders, lol.</p><p>Of note on the page: We get to see more of Chrys' robe from a couple of chapters ago, and also, seriously, who buys porn in this day and age?</p>
