Both Jessica and I have been plagued by power outages thanks to the storms that have been plaguing both our areas. She sent me this line-art before collapsing from exhaustion. Like many digital artists, she'll firm up the line-art in a last bit of work before adding the color. I'll have more to talk about then but for now, I need to go clean up my yard. Lot of work to be done.<br>

<br> plz tell me what Mandrake is saying here!<br>

<br> Roughly speaking it's "There's 10 guys that will shoot Mandrake!"&nbsp; (Or penis mandrake, but I'm betting it's shoot.)<br><br>Then "No!"<br>Then "Not Chrys's gamble!&nbsp; Not Chrys's Plan!"<br>

<br> i thought it was "No dice!" or something. and the power outages could have been caused from the solar flare a week or two ago.
