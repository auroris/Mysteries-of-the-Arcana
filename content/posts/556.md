It took about three hours to fully update.</p><p>I'm enjoying Windows 10 so far. The interface is clean and stylish.

I have two machines, a workstation and a gaming computer. Both are  registered for Windows 10. Both inform me that Windows 10 is being  rolled out in waves, and I'll be notified when my wave is ready... but  not yet.&nbsp; I'm sure I'll be notified at least a second before my wave  crushes me into Narn dung. I look forward to it <img alt=" ThumbsUp " src="//smilies/thumbsup.gif" hspace="2" border="0" vspace="2"><br><br>&nbsp; On a side note: Say J, have you explored your admin dashboard yet? Eh?<br><br>

<br> Unsure as of yet. If I'll update, it definitely won't be until near end of the year at the least though. That gives them some time to find and correct some more bugs.<br>

<br> I plan to install it on my desktop, try it out, and then maybe install it on my laptop (which would be more of a pain, because I'd need to expand the C drive first) if I like it or roll back to 7 if I decide it's a terrible OS.
