<p>I want to apologize. There won't be a new page until Monday. A close friend of Keith's has died and he asked for a little time off to attend to that. </p><p>Thank you for understanding.</p>

<br> Absolutely. &nbsp;Thanks for the warning, too - so nobody starts bitching about "lazy artista".

<br> As someone who's lost two friends and two family members over the last three months, I can relate. Condolences to Keith and take care.<br>
