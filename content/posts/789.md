       <p>Alright, so, I've been hard at work, getting the foundations laid for what's coming.</p><p>I have to admit, this has had me more energized than I've been in quite a while. This has, in a lot of ways, felt like coming home.</p><p>The first chapter is written, with Sabrena working hard on chapter 2. </p><p>All that being said, meet Alyx. Alyx is an AFAB nonbinary demihuman. They bear characteristics of all three parents. Those parents being Theresa, Chrys, and William. Theresa doesn't mind Alyx not bearing her surname. After all, Smith is a bit generic, isn't it? While you guys are waiting patiently, if you want a peek under the hood, pop on over to the <a href="https://legacyofthefool.com/" target="_blank">new website</a>. In preparation for all of this, it was decided to tell this new story on its own website, so as to not confuse readers who may stumble upon the archive here. While I hope to resume this story with J at some future point, his life as a successful TTRPG writer has definitely taken that off the table for now. </p><p>I will be using this space to give you guys some introductions to the new cast in preparation for the comic launch in January. In the meantime, along with the website, I have also launched a <a href="https://patreon.com/legacyofthefool" target="_blank">Patreon</a>. Why the early launch you may ask? Because I am passionate about what Sabrena and I have planned, I've already invested not just time, but a bit of money into this endeavor, and while we're preparing to launch, I figured having a space to showcase some of what's to come, and attempt to get a little bit of a cushion for the initial finances would not be amiss.</p><p>I will be posting a few more images over the coming days, giving you some peeks at updated looks and new characters.</p><p>Until next post,</p><p>Keira W.</p>

One option on desktop is to do a page inspect, to see what images are in what position, but I realize that's a complicated mess.
