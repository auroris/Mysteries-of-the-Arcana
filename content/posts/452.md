<p><strong>Hidden Name: </strong>Gunsolo</p><hr><p>So, after podcast discussions last night, I've been thinking a fair bit about mascots. Ultimately, if you guys had your pick, who would you say would be the mascot for MotA? And what other mascots are you guys fond of?</p>

<br> The most obvious answer is Lesbian Elf Kisses. <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">

<br> Panel 1: Mandrake notices that the windows are so dirty that I was able to write my name on them. <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br><br>I'd pick Mandrake or William as the MotA mascot, as they both show how otherworldly the setting is.<br>
