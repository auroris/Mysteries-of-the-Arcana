After a long (too long) hiatus, here's our first new page of Mysteries of the Arcana! We are continuing where we left off, with the Telling - the story of the origin of the Arcana. Today we see the creation of most of the minor arcana.<div><br></div><div>Chapter four&nbsp;<a href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/index.php?action=comics&amp;cid=386" class="" classname="" target="_blank" name="">began here</a>.</div><div>The Telling <a href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/index.php?action=comics&amp;cid=398" class="" classname="" target="_blank" name="">began here</a>.</div><div><br></div><div>We'll be posting regularly until the end of chapter 4 which will take us into February.</div><div><br></div><div>For today, however, once you're done reading (and commenting!) here why not go over to <a href="http://comiccreatorsforfreedom.com/" class="" classname="" target="_blank" name="">Comic Creators 4 Freedom</a>!

<br> Welcome back guys!<br>It's particularily awesome to see Keith's artwork again, I especially like his take on the last panel. Having seen J Gray's description of it a few updates ago I thought It would be a rather tricky image to make, but now this feels like an obvious solution. Great work!<br>
