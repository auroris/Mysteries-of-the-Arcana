<p>Hello? Is anyone out there? You guys have been awfully quiet lately. I think I understand, though. You're probably at the "yet another trailer and you wish the damn movie would start already" phase. I've been there myself! Hold on just a few more days and we'll be back to Mysteries of the Arcana, I promise!</p><p>In the meanwhile, you really should check out <a href="https://www.comic-rocket.com/explore/of-stars-and-swords/" target="_blank">Of Stars and Swords</a>. Gorgeous art. Beautiful writing. A strong, female lead. It really is worth reading.</p><p>See you tomorrow!</p>

<br> That's because there's too many webcomics to read! It's hard to keep up! <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">

<br> That's because I've been gorging on all the archives from the webcomics you've been posting. &nbsp; Its all your fault.

<br> That's because I went back into Lurker mode for a while. <br>Too many trailers, not enough time to read all the comics. Iï¿½ve actually read through the entire archive of dream*scar (it's very good, I lost some sleep during that archive binge), about a hundred pages of Sombulus and three chapters of Monkey Island... err... I mean Lasalle's legacy. <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br>Webcomic wednesday sounds like a pretty good idea.<br><br>Those Lego figures in the last post were friggin awesome!<br><br>Looking forward to the start of chapter 5 on monday!<br><br>Oh, and the Wall of the arcane looks very nice. <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br>
