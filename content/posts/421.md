<p>And welcome to the hiatus! As promised, each day we're going to let another webcomic borrow our space in an effort to convince our readers become their readers. First up is a series with some amazing style. Seriously, the art is gorgeous and retro. It is called <a href="https://www.comic-rocket.com/explore/decrypting-rita/" target="_blank">Decrypting Rita</a>.</p><p>You might notice that for most of these webcomics, if not all of them, I'll be linking you to them via <a href="https://www.comic-rocket.com/" target="_blank">Comic Rocket</a>. That's because I genuinely believe Comic Rocket is an amazing friend to webcomics and I want to support them as well.</p><p>Over the next two weeks I'll be making a few changes to the site. Nothing big and some of it may be experimental but don't be surprised if you come here and find things a little different.</p><p>See you tomorrow!</p>

<br>Oh, now that is a lovely little tale.<br>Completely mad, with the multiple realities and the teleportation and the cybord and wizards and glowy sword things. But the nice kind of completely mad.

I love the art. It speaks to the very best of the art movements of the 70s. Minimalist and full of motion.<br><br>
