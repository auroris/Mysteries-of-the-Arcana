I could use my imagination to project him into any story. He could go gallivanting with Taran the Assistant Pig-Keeper in the Prydian Chronicles, cross the a galaxy far, far away with Luke Skywalker, or wander the mean streets of Boston with Spenser and Hawk. I'll admit, he was a total Mary Sue.</p>  <p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">As time went on and I matured my mental stories about Chrys' father wandered away from taking part in other people's adventures. He began to have adventures of his own. I'm not sure when he had a daughter but he did and at some point, I realized my imagination plays were staring her more and more and him less and less. By the time I began developing Mysteries of the Arcana as a webcomic there was no question that she would take center stage.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\">By the way, in case there was any question, Chrys' dad is the guy who looks like her. The other two? Kludge and Melody.<br></p>",
