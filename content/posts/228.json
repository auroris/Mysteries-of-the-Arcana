I completely disagree with SoySauce!Theresa shouldn't complain: Considering everything, they got out of that one terribly well! Not only were they completely unarmed by the explosion, it seems her clothing is mostly anti-goat-frog-guts since there's only a few tiny spots! So no harm, and minimal amount of cloth washing required. That sounds like a nearly perfect plan to me!&nbsp;"
