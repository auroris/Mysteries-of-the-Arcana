<p><strong>Hidden Name: </strong>Boston Metaphysical Society</p><hr><p>So, typically when I'm working on a page, I try to have music going right along with me. Today's page was soundtracked by mostly Doctor Who related musics. Sometimes I lean more toward heavier metal, or metalcore when I am working on other projects.</p><p>What kind of music do you guys listen to?</p>

<br> Rock and alt-rock, mostly. Some symphonic metal has made its way into my playlist as well.<br>

<br> Music?...Pretty much whatever hear that I like.<br><br>And now to figure out what the old pervert wants and how to end him. Hmmm Perhaps some "Screams of the Damned" is called for.<br>

<br> I listen to everything from classical, big band, 50s-70s rock, heavy mithril, symphonic metal, Voltaire and Emilie Autumn (gfl trying to put either of them in a category. You'll need a HUGE shoehorn), gothic synth in the style of The Birthday Massacre.... Yeah. Long list.<br>
