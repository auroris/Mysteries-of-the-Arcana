<p>I'll let you form your own opinions about Mister Mist.</p><p>There was some discussion about the rifle Theresa was examining. I don't want to give too much away yet because the rifle actually is a plot point. I will say this, though.</p><p>1. It is a real rifle that shoots real bullets. It is not something quite as primitive as a squirrel gun.</p><p>2. It does have a magazine. It is located just in front of the forward hand grip and is obscured in most panels. Theresa is seen removing the magazine in the second panel of the previous page.</p><p>3. The rifle is based on a real rifle that existed and was used in open combat during a major war.</p><p>So, there you go! You'll find out more information about the rifle as the comic continues. Like I said, it is a plot point.</p><p>---</p><p>Finally! I have a new book out.</p><p><a href="http://drivethrurpg.com/product/161132/The-Dragons-Hoard-Magic-Arms--Armor" target="_blank">The Dragon's Hoard: Magic Arm &amp; Armor</a> is a toybox book with over 60 new weapons, shields, armors, and magic item properties for Pathfinder. If you're a Pathfinder player, this is good book to have on your shelf. I was co-editor on this one. I get a cut from every sale, so buying it gets you neat new magic toys and helps me out. The cost is $4.99.</p><p>See you Monday!</p>

<br> Oh my, the mysterious mr. Mist is manifest. He puts me in mind of another man by the moniker "Jack".  <br><br>Err..  That is to say, this guy reminds me of Jack Skellington. <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">

<br> Ah! I'd missed that part with her removing the magazin on the first read-through. Now that I'v seen however I also remember the gun that inspired the design.<br><br>And I'll certainly take a look at that book. Your earlier work did not disappoint.<br>

<br> I am certain that Theresa would never point a rifle at her head, so we also know that it's easy and quick to remove the barrel from this rifle.&nbsp; We saw her looking down the barrel in the last panel of comic 608 ("What's Theresa Doing?") so the barrel must not have been attached to the rifle at that time.<br><br>I am certain that Theresa knows and follows Cooper's four laws of firearm safety:<br><br>1. All guns are always loaded.&nbsp; (No exceptions to the other laws because "it's not loaded")<br><br>2. Never point a gun at anything you are not willing to destroy.<br><br>3. Keep your finger off the trigger until you are ready to shoot.&nbsp; (Hollywood screws this one up a lot)<br><br>4. Be sure of your target, and what is behind and beyond your target.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Cooper#Firearms_safety<br>

<br> ... It reminds me of a Thompson for some reason, but that was a submachine gun, not a rifle.
