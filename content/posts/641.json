It has been a while since I reminded people about the <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/user?ty=h&amp;u=452395\" target=\"_blank\">Patreon that supports Mysteries of the Arcana</a>. So, let me remind you! <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/user?ty=h&amp;u=452395\">Mysteries of the Arcana has a Patreon</a>! It supports this comic. It pays for the art. It sometimes even pays me a little. And it needs all the help you can give it. Please consider <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/user?ty=h&amp;u=452395\" target=\"_blank\">becoming a patron of Mysteries of the Arcana</a>! If you are already a patron, thank you!</p><p>There. I think I linked that enough!</p><p>In other news! Chapter 7 of Mysteries of the Arcana will be, I have decided, a series of vignettes staring one or two cast members each. If you're a fan of A:tlA, think \"Tales of Ba Sing Se\". We'll be leading off with two stories some of you have read but others haven't and then doing several original stories.</p><p>Want to vote on which character you want to see in the third story? Now's your chance! Head over to <a href=\"http://www.poll-maker.com/poll699570x76EC4Af0-28\" target=\"_blank\">the poll I created </a>and pick someone! Or someones! If the character or combination of characters you want to see isn't listed, come back here and leave a comment telling me who I should be including!</p><p>See you Monday!</p>",
