<p>Hello, everyone! Thanks for putting up with the slow pace of chapter 6. Right now, one update a week is what we can afford. Hopefully, as time marches on, that'll change.</p><p>Keith has asked me to inform everyone about a Kickstarter being held to raise funds for a Starship Moonhawk audio drama. He's heavily involved as producer and director. His band (did you know he has a band) is also producing the music. You can find <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/starship-moonhawk-the-death-of-perseus-audiobook" target="_blank">more information here.</a></p><p>There'll be a new Bricks of the Arcana on Friday and a new story comic next Wednesday.</p><p>See you then!</p>
