<p>Don't you just hate it when you're almost out the door scott free, and someone spots you and suddenly wants your attention?</p><p>Seems William gets to experience this sensation with Theresa. And, if you are curious, William's at the Inn's front doors, and Theresa is yelling from the door that goes into the kitchen area. So, who knows what she wants? I guess William will just have to see.</p><p>On an unrelated note: I thought my wrist was all good, and in the course of cleaning house two nights ago, I managed to make it angry with me again, so back in the brace I go.</p><p>See you guys Monday!</p>
