<p><strong>Hidden Name</strong>: Ben Hudson</p><hr><p>First, I want to apologize to Peggy over at Samhain Night. She was nice enough to do a filler for us a few days back and we weren't able to link to her comic for a plug due to technical errors. So, let's fix that.</p><p>Go read the gorgeous, Celtic mythology rich <a href="http://samhainnight.com/the-comic/" target="_blank">Samhain Night</a> right after you read this blog!</p><p>Now, to remind everyone. Blue is a sentient color. He's literally an intelligent version of the color blue. Physically, this translates into a blue goo which can heal people. Blue usually stays inside the space suit because it finds that interacting with a world meant for people who aren't sentient shades of colors gets easier when one has hands and thumbs and a voice box/speaker. However, Baron Sir seems to have made the mistake of assuming that if Blue's outside of his suit, he's harmless.</p><p>Whoops!</p><p>See you Monday!</p>

<br> He might want to modify his assumption to: "mostly harmless".<br><img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br>

<br> I find myself remembering an "Exiern" panel that said "CLOMP!"

<br> when you're fighting a sentient BLOB, it's always good to keep an eye cocked to the floor.<br>
