<p>Like the title of today's page says, here are William and Circe's lines for the chapter. This particular chapter will focus heavily on Theresa and Chrys. The other characters appear but they don't get much play this time around.</p><p>And now, I'm gonna put on my NPR/PBS pledge drive voice.</p><p>Mysteries of the Arcana happens because 12 people who read this comic believe in it so much that they are willing to pay for it. 12 people out there pay the money I use to pay Keith and Wendy Wood for art - both for the story pages and the Bricks of the Arcana pages. Without them, this comic would just be a dead spot on the internet that never updated.</p><p>12 people.</p><p>I know more than 12 people read Mysteries of the Arcana, either page by page or in chunks every few weeks. Our metrics say so. So, I'm gonna ask again.</p><p><a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=452395" target="_blank">Please consider donating to our Patreon</a>, even if it is only a dollar or two a month. Every single dollar counts. Right now, we're $69/month away from being able to return to two updates per week. Keith and I would love to get back to a faster story progression.</p><p>So, think about it, please. Is Mysteries of the Arcana worth supporting?</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>New Bricks of the Arcana on Friday. New story comic next Wednesday.</p>
