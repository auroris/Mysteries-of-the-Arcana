I am currently playing around with the multiplayer demo for Mass Effect 3. I'm enjoying it a lot more than I thought I would. That is a pleasant surprise. Still, it is no substitute for the real thing and I'll be pleased as punch when the full game comes out on March 6th.<br><br>No deep thoughts today, folks. Enjoy the page. Next week, the story ends! This chapter, anyway.<br>

<br> Wow. I didn't realize until this page, but Theresa looks especially attractive with the new art.

<br> @Felix-&nbsp; thank you.&nbsp; I've been working at binging out the fact that Teresa is quite beautiful, and is really not aware of it at all.<br>
