I thought it would be nice to remind people that Chrys, Theresa, William, and Mandrake aren't the only ones out there slogging through the trenches, battling monsters, and otherwise performing feats of daring do in order to procure for Circe the items she needs to run the inn. No, other teams are out there as well!<br><br>Such as Melody and Kludge! Look at how hard they're working!<br>

<br> Love the gargoyle.&nbsp; He's just scenery, but he does well at it.&nbsp; There is an arcana where gargoyles serve drinks; cool.<br>

<br> Is it wrong that I prefer Melody to Theresa?<br>

If you just like Melody better as a character? No.<br><br>If you're shipping Melody and Chrys? Yes. Yes, it is wrong. Very wrong.<br><br><br>
