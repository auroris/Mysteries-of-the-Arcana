Thus far, Chrys's powers divide neatly into two categories: class and racial. To borrow some D&amp;D terminology.</p><p>Among her \"class\" skills are Chrys's various spells (the cloth charming music spell, the detection spell she used to locate land minds and her all important blast the crap out of stuff spell). For \"racial\" abilities she can Dreamwalk and now we know she has an inherent understanding of environmental conditions of other arcana. We'll be revealing at least one more Dreamer power before the end of the chapter.</p><p>Anyway, see you Thursday!</p><p>I'm so excited to say that.</p>",
