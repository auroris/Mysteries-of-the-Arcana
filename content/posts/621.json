Its impressive.</p><p>Mind you, I spent part of my weekend re-reading through the archives of <a href=\"http://www.egscomics.com/\" target=\"_blank\">El Goonish Shive</a> so maybe it isn't as impressive as it could be but I'm still pretty proud. Also, damn you Dan Shive for being so awesome. </p><p>Ahem.</p><p>Do you like ponies? My Little Ponies? Do you play RPGs? Did you know there's a MLP-like world setting for Pathfinder called <a href=\"http://ponyfinder.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Ponyfinder</a>? Did you know that I've written an adventure for that setting that's all about finding a pony pirate queen's hidden treasure?</p><p>You didn't!</p><p>Well I did! <a href=\"http://ponyfinder.net/\" target=\"_blank\">You can buy it here</a>!</p><p>Yay! Pony pirates! Arrrggggh pony!</p><p>See you Thursday.</p>",
