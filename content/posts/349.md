And with this page, we end Chrys and Mandrake's part of the story. What do you think? Has Chrys learned her lesson? Will it stick or will she revert to type?<br><br>&nbsp;Next week, we begin the epilogue! For those of you who love Chrys and Theresa together, I'm pleased to say the epilogue focuses entirely on them. In addition, during the epilogue I'll be providing commentary not just on this chapter but on the entire series!<br><br>Join us next week for more!<br>
