<p>And here we go! The last page of Mysteries of the Arcana in the year 2015! It'll be 5 whole years before we have a year divisible by 5 people! </p><p>FIVE YEARS!</p><p>Surely that means something ominous and horrible is coming. Something evil. Something like...</p><p>... chapter 7 of Mysteries of the Arcana! I've started work on it! Of course, I already had some ideas of what I wanted to happen but now I'm working out specifics. We will get a lovely look at Mandrake's home arcana, the Moon, in chapter 7!</p><p>BTW, something was wrong with the comments, which is why some of you couldn't post any. That's been fixed and people can comment to their heart's content!</p><p>See you in 2016!</p>
