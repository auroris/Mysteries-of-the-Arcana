Gennifer prepared this gorgeous bit of art to celebrate the holidays, Mysteries of the Arcana style! <br><br>This being both the holidays and the end of the year, I want to thank the people who have made Mysteries of the Arcana possible. My loving wife, of course, who puts up with me making the comic. Keith, Sarrah, Jessica, and Gennifer. Without these four artists, the comic wouldn't have been possible and wouldn't have made it this far. Rox, who helped design the current site. And last, but never least, JD, who provides hosting, technical and moral support.<br><br>Sorry, that wasn't the last. Thank you to each of you, the readers of Mysteries of the Arcana. Thank you for supporting the comic and sticking with us through our troubles.<br><br>Happy holidays, each and every one of you.<br>

<br> Actually, if you play Resident Evil 4, you will recognize the Hand Cannon from that game.<br>

<br> Ah ha.  That explains it - don't play any recent games.
