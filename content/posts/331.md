Well, that was fun! Power went out here Saturday night. That was while the area was being blanketed with about thirteen inches of snow. Fortunately, I had the foresight to shovel the drive-way during the storm so it was easier to dig the car out on Sunday. From there, there was a quest for heat. Ended up staying in two different locations until the power was restored at home.<br><br>I hope Mystery of the Arcana readers in the northeast are safe and sound. Shout out and let us know you're okay!<br>
