Its the start of spring and, yet, we have snow. I'm so tired of snow.<br><br>Bleh.<br><br>Thank you all for sticking with us to this point. I realize this hasn't been an action heavy storyline but it has been, I feel, important to the development of both Chrys and Theresa and their relationship.<br>

<br> I dunno. William seems to be in the process of giving Theresa the action-packed kick to the behind that she needs!

<br> I just wanted to say that I think the dialog in this and the other recent pages are really great. Its not that previous chapters didnt have good dialog its just that I have felt its gotten better now. <br>
