There were two different ER visits, a surgery, snowpocalypse, and now I am rather ill. J's still working crazy on his end, and we'll be reconvening in the near future to get back to the ongoing of chapter 8, but I myself, will hopefully be back to finishing up this little story next week (I'm hoping I can close it out in another 2-3 pages, 4 at the most).</p><p>Again, apologies, and thanks for sticking with us.</p><p>Keith W.</p><p>That artist person</p>",
