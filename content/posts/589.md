       <p>Yep. I'm on a quest. How many times can I put the word 'squirrel' into a page title. I'm lucky, I guess. Most comic writers don't get to name their individual page titles the way I do! Lucky... or cursed. </p><p>Time to promote another Pathfinder-compatible RPG product. Not for myself, though! Nope! Keith Wood, the man you know and love as the artist behind this comic, has branched out. His first RPG product, <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/166020/Spooky-Gardens-Autumn-Special" target="_blank">Spooky Gardens Autumn Special</a>, was just released. I believe he has four different horrifying plants depicted in that book using his unique artistic skills. Consider picking it up and giving it a review, noting how much you like the art. Keith can always use more work.</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>
