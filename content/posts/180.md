The mood is going to grow heavier from this point forward. There will still be moments of humor (I hope) but as we delve into Theresa's "quest" we'll see the shadows that haunt her and what drove her towards suicide. This chapter will be a huge challenge for me as a writer and, I hope, enjoyable and thought provoking for you as readers.<br>
