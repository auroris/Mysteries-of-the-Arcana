I normally don't play multiplayer only FPS because I a) like story and b) don't like people online much BUT...</p><p>... a game which not only puts a woman on the front of the box but puts a LGBT+ woman on the front of the box AND includes characters who are on the autism spectrum... well, I feel like I should support that.</p><p>For those of you who were having trouble with our experiment in animation, Keith and I will work on a solution after the holidays end. I apologize. I know it not working on iPads and phones is an annoyance. The reason is because it is Flash based and Apple and Adobe don't get along anymore.</p><p>Because I'm not going to ask Keith to work during the holiday weekend, we'll have a filler on Monday featuring our favorite couple.</p><p>See you then!</p>",
