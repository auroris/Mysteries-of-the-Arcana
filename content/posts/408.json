Thursday's page is going to be gorgeous and filled with more tarot symbolism than we've ever had in a single page in this comic!</p><p>In the meanwhile, our <a href=\"http://kickstarter.com/projects/355389852/mysteries-of-the-arcana-chapter-5\" target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter</a> is still running! With just ten days left we've raised $3,608 out of $4,100. Which means we have less than $500 to go and we're fully funded. If you can, please help us out. We don't get the money unless the funding goal is met.</p><p>Thanks so much and see you on Thursday for the next page of the Telling!</p>",
