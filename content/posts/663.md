<p>And with this we finish Fly Away Home! Monday, we'll go back to art by Keith with a story entitled Jailbreak. </p><p>Just an update on my wife's cancer treatment progress. Chemo is done. We've got a little under a month off before surgery and radiation. After that, regular visits for pretty much ever just to keep track of possible aftereffects.</p><p>Give someone you love a hug tonight.</p><p>See you Monday for the next story!</p>

<br> That's definitely a lot to cope with. I hope your wife's illness works out okay. Many glomps for you and huggles for your loved ones. <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">
