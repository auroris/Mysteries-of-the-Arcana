<p>Hidden Name: General Guster McWheezepants</p><hr><p>Today's hidden name comes from a loyal reader whom I assume has the good taste to be a Psych fan.</p><p>This will be the last page using the garage as a backdrop this chapter. Keith's glad because he's really tired of drawing the Beast. I doubt I'll get him to illustrate the Beauty and the Beast spin-off comic in which Chrys steals the truck and they have wacky adventures together.</p><p>I was just kidding there. And did you see the eyes? Aren't they freaking creepy?</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>

<br> I finished going through the pages I've missed, this year's been rather hard on me personally. Nothing like what Keith went through, but in some ways worse.<br><br>Also, I love Alucard.<br>
