I don't know if it is Theresa's expression or the words 'total yuppie zombie apocolypse' or the two combined, but that panel alone has filled me with good cheer.<br><br>In all seriousness, for the original residents of this arcana, he's the Tower. First, they built and built, accomplishing things and becoming obsessed with perfection. Then, when they finally achieved their perfection, it destroyed them. In other words, their tower came crumbling down around them. The old was destroyed in order to make way for the new... in this case, William's people. As is always the case, though, the old refuses to just go away. The past always sticks around, either to inform us... or haunt us.",

Are there animal horrors too? Or did they die out cause they couldn't drink the water? Or is that what turned them into animals?"
