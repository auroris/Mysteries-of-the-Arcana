There we go. Now, to answer some questions that have been asked and respond to some comments.</p><p>First, the hidden name a few back should have been Crimson Rhen. The creators of Shadowbinders backed our Kickstarter (and are good friends of MotA and vice versa). I do apologize for messing up the name they asked to be hidden.</p><p>As for what Mandrake ran into a few pages back, that was the security door. Remember, the dastardly Baron Sir ordered Ruby to turn the power back on and initiate lock-down. That brought down a security curtain over the exploded main entrance of the Inn's tap room.</p><p>Tis danger. What shall happen to our friends!</p>
