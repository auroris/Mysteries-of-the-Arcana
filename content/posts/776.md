<p>So, this should answer the question about whether the amulet is simply casting an illusion, or actually transforming William physically.</p><p>Also, I have a greater appreciation for J when he writes for characters like William now. His manner of speech is interesting, and difficult at times, to make it "feel" proper. I actually reworded his dialog three times after realizing he wouldn't speak in contractions. In that regard, he kind of reminds me of Data from TNG, since that's actually an important plot point in one particular episode in determining what is or isn't real.</p><p>Anyway, we're almost done with the girl's fawning over William so he can get about his..."quest"?</p>
