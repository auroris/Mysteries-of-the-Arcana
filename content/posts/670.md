<p>First off, let me apologize for page delay. Work things and whatnot keeping everyone in the office busy.</p><p>Secondly! Thanks to everyone for the birthday wishes. I'm still trucking right along with the shootout, and hopefully you guys are enjoying what's turning into a bit of unbridled action.</p><p>Stay tuned and we'll see you guys on Monday.</p><p>Keith W.</p>
