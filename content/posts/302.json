You'll find out which guess was right (and at least one was!) next Friday.<br><br>A few weeks ago, <a name=\"\" target=\"_blank\" classname=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"http://www.tangents.us/2011/06/06/mysteries-of-the-arcana/\">Tangents did a wonderful review of Mysteries of the Arcana</a>. The site was very kind to MotA and quite positive. Please go read the review and all the other wonderful content there.<br><br>Finally, Jessica has asked me to note to you all that Mysteries of the Arcana is often drawn LIVE! That's right, you can watch her stream the site. They usually happen at night. The best way to find out if she's streaming is to<a name=\"\" target=\"_blank\" classname=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"http://twitter.com/#%21/Senshuu\"> follow Jessica's twitter feed</a>.
