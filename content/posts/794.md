<p>January is quickly approaching! I hope you guys are all ready! I know we're excited on this end. But either way! Here's the cover.</p><p><br>For now, I'm thinking we're going to be starting off with a comic a week, posting on Mondays. Patreon will get the pages one week ahead of site publishing here. Any support we get through the patreon itself will be used to pay Sabrena and myself, as well as maintain the site, domain, and such.</p><p>You can join the Patreon <a href="https://patreon.com/legacyofthefool" target="_blank">Here!</a><br><br>Don't forget to join the Discord, as well. The comic will be cross-shared there to the discord forum for discussions, and you can interact with us as well! <a href="https://discord.gg/eEhX57MatG" target="_blank">Here!</a></p><p>See you there, guys!<br>Keira</p>
