Some people guessed this a few pages back, but the speech patterns of the Horrors are heavily inspired by those of Norm, the mechanical man, from Phineas and Ferb. For those of you not familiar, Phineas and Ferb is an Emmy winning musical, animated show that can be seen on the Disney and Disney XD channels. The creators of the show, Dan Povenmire and Jeff "Swampy" Marsh worked on series like the Simpsons, Rocko's Modern Life, and Family Guy before this and their rather biting sense of humor shines through, though the show itself remains family friendly. <br><br>The show's about two young boys, Phineas and Ferb, who are determined to squeeze the most fun they can out of every single day of summer. They do this by embarking on wild projects that range from building a roller coast across town to fixing a time machine to becoming one hit wonders. Though the boys don't know it, their pet platypus, Perry, is also Agent P. Agent P works for the O.W.C.A. (Organization Without a Cool Acronym), an agency dedicated to battling evil. His nemesis is Dr. Doofenshmirtz, an evil scientist who loves his daughter and seeks to conquer the Tri-State area. Norm is Doofenshmirtz's assistant, a robot that tends to speak in suburbia cliches.<br><br>Anyway, the show is brilliant and you should watch it. Don't believe me? Check out this clip. In it, Phineas and Ferb decide to help their friend Baljeet build a portal to Mars, Bollywood style.<br><br><span><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/RO5mSAXIzKQ" allowfullscreen="" width="480" frameborder="0" height="390"></iframe></span><br><br><br>

<br> I was thinking of Phineas and Ferb when i read what the Horrors were saying, but&nbsp;i thought, "No,&nbsp;webcomic producers probably don't watch some silly kids show (which i love)." I'm glad I was wrong <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">&nbsp;

<br> You may not be aware of this, but "O.W.C.A." in Polish (language spoken in Poland, feom whence I am) is an achronym for the word "owca" which means "sheep". Bet you didn't know that! ;p<br><br>Also, keep up the good work, polish your skills and continue the epic journey of your charas in the comic! :D<br>

<br> Also, Phineas &amp; Ferb kicks ass. The Disney XD's translations are of high quality - I for example watched the whole show in Polish, English and Spanish cause of little differences, like the songs that are sometimes quite different, but still superb! <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br>

<br> I love P and F. I've thrown a few refs into a comic I write for as well. <br>
