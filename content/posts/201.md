I just got in from the fireworks show and have a long drive ahead of me, tomorrow. So, I'll make this short and sweet. <br><br>First, the title of this page is accurate. It is going to get a LOT worse for Theresa before it gets better.<br><br>Second, do you have a question about me or the comic? The characters, the setting, or the plot? I have a formspring account where people can submit questions either anonymously or not. Please, ask away. I love getting these questions. They help me further focus my own thoughts of Mysteries of the Arcana. The address is:<br><br><a name="" target="_blank" classname="" class="" href="http://www.formspring.me/J GrayWebcomic">http://www.formspring.me/J GrayWebcomic</a><br>

<br> Good to see a challenge Theresa can't solve with her gun. Should be interesting.

The goo isn't really a she, even if it looks like it...<br><br>... and the single braid in the back is a clue. You've seen her before...<br><br><br>

It's obviously Debbie.&nbsp; Theresa's incredibly upset again and since her face was in the goo when Theresa threw it up.&nbsp; But I am trying to be patient to find out what happened to Debbie.&nbsp; My guess is Debbie died and Theresa feels guilty about the circumstance.&nbsp; So pat yourself on the back JGrey, all the foreshadowing is driving me nuts.<br><br>
