<p>So, we go from me being down with the flu, to J now dying (figuratively) of the plague. Sorry for the slow updates.</p><p>So, it seems, despite her own appreciation of her clever plan, Mandrake may have overlooked a critical flaw in her plan...but it seems she has a solution...</p><p>What is that, you might ask? Well, tune in next week to find out! (hopefully J's phoenix tears will kick in by then).</p><p>And if not, tune in anyway for some brand new, just for you guys, placeholder art!</p><p>Keith W.</p>
