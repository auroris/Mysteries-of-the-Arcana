No one explained how the Knower got so big or why the Royal Road exists.<br><br>So many people showed interest in the Horrors, however, that I decided to tell their story. Over this and the next few pages you'll find out how the horrors went from yuppies to super powered terrors.<br><br>Keep in mind as you read that this arcana is the Tower. The Tower is a card of the ruin that comes after building to great heights.",

      "text": "The destruction represented by the Tower is needed. Without tearing down old ideas, new ones can't grow. Stone from the tower can be used to build new structures. In a way, the milestones of our life are the Tower. Graduating from high school. Moving away from home for the first time. Moving to a new job or home. Getting married. Having children. They all require you to let go (destroy) the old in order to move forward to the new."
