<p><strong>Hidden Name</strong>: Ray</p><hr><p>Keith and I like showing off shirtless William. But, let's be honest. If you had a physique like his, wouldn't you show off, too?</p><p>I can just see William in a scar showing off contest. "Sniper! The Fool! 2014!" "Shaving accident! My bathroom! Yesterday!" Not that William would admit to shaving his legs.</p><p>What do you think of Blue's new suit? It isn't as friendly and silly as his old one but, well, Blue's gone from being the silly backwards talking guy to the goo that can kill you pretty much whenever he wants.</p><p>See you Monday!</p>

<br> Ok.... So Blue has a spare suit. Does that make him Blue - Ray? Do his powers include the ability to play hi-def video? He'd be awesome at parties.<img alt=" Drinking " src=" /smilies/drinking.gif " hspace="2" vspace="2" border="0"><br>
