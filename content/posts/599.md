<p>And we're back! I hope everyone had a very good Christmas and/or December 25th, depending on what you celebrate.</p><p>I got a few gifts! My family was nice enough to renew my Playstation Plus subscription. I got the Infernal Relics, Rook City, Wrath of the Cosmos, and Shattered Timelines expansions for Sentinels of the Multiverse, the comic book/superhero card game. I also got the Omnitron IV, Final Wasteland, Scholar, Miss Information, and Guise mini-expansion. So, awesome all around. Also, I used my Christmas money to pick up Fallout 4 (w/ season pass), and the Simpsons level pack for LEGO Dimensions. I preordered the Ghostbusters level pack. That doesn't come out for a bit. </p><p>And, of course, there was a 2 pound set of peanut butter cups. Mmm.</p><p>What did you get? Share! Share!</p><p>And if any of you have Sentinels of the Multiverse digital, speak up! I'd love to play with you.</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>
