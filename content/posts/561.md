<p>Wow, this page was late. Entirely my fault and I apologize. Keith was behind on a page due to some RL stuff. For some reason I was convinced he was behind on THIS page and not the next page. Of course, this page had been sitting in my email box for days...</p><p>So, I feel like an idiot.</p><p>Florida was hot and sweaty. LEGOLand was awesome and so much fun! The Wizarding World of Harry Potter was beautiful but so crowded I couldn't enjoy it.</p><p>What have you been up to?</p>

<br> Help a newbie out: the banner at the top says updates are Wednesday &nbsp;and Friday but you say the page was late today, and today is Tuesday. Are you in a different time zone, or is the banner wrong?
