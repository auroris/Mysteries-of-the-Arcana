So there you have it. Theresa and William were inside the goat-frog. Now, they're not. Because there is no goat-frog. Just lots and lots of goat-frog guts.<br><br>A stunt goat-frog was used in the making of this comic. No actual goat-frogs were harmed.<br>

<br> Ok, so apparently the goat-frog already <span style="font-style: italic;">was</span> big enough to eat them... and did.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Plan:</span>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">a:</span> Get yourself eaten by a big goat-frog.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">b:</span> Slither on down to it's stomach. (short trip, froggies are almost <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> stomach)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">c:</span> Grab it's bezoar stone. *an indigestible mass with supposedly magical properties*<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">d:</span> Remove yourself from goat-frog's tummy.&nbsp; Easy way = explosives.<br><br>Don't you just love it when a plan comes together?<br>

<br> I disapprove of this. I demand to see REAL comic creatures getting blown up. &gt;_&gt;

<br>Whew, that's a relief to know that no real goat-frogs were blown up. I completely disagree with SoySauce!Theresa shouldn't complain: Considering everything, they got out of that one terribly well! Not only were they completely unarmed by the explosion, it seems her clothing is mostly anti-goat-frog-guts since there's only a few tiny spots! So no harm, and minimal amount of cloth washing required. That sounds like a nearly perfect plan to me!&nbsp;
