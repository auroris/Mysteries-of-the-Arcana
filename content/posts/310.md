William isn't an easy character to portray. You've got a jackal anthromorph with digitigrade legs in high tech space armor with a fair amount of detail. You've somehow got to give that character expression on a face lacking typical human features. Fortunately, Gennifer did a fantastic job with William. She even managed to give him a very inscrutable, samurai warrior vibe.<br><br>I'm hoping to get one more portrait up this weekend and then we'll become publishing pages again come Monday!<br>
