<br> Three words: Lesbian. Elf. Kisses. (True Loves First Kiss) That page was adorable. From the look on Theresia's face when she gets kissed, to the "Wait! I need pants!" chibi comic, this is the page that has always stuck out to me the most to me.

<br> The first page showing the horrors. The idea of creatures wearing the facade of a sterotyped 1950's style Nueclear Family with the whole 'perfect suburbia' feel to how they talk and act has so much uncanny and grotesque potential that I love it. And so far your delivering on everything.<br>
