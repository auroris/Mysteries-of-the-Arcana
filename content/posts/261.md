... Chrys might very well be a bard. Sure, she's used magic before but she's certainly showing some roguish qualities here, isn't she?<br><br>What do you think?<br>

<br> I'm just thinking that Mandrake's gonna have a roguish revenge scheme of her own when this is done.<br>

<br> LOL "exit, stage left".&nbsp; Wonder if she should at least wait to see what this great ride is like.&nbsp;

<br> A bard would fit her but I personally see her being a Chaotic good if not lawful good mage-bard.<br><br>Theresa would definitely be a Chaotic Neutral with a Warrior slant and perhaps Berserker rage.<br>
