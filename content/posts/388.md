<div>First, news! Keith and I have worked out a firm date for our return. Mysteries of the Arcana will begin updating again on December 2, 2013. We should run straight through the end of chapter 4 before our next &nbsp;(much shorter) break.</div><div><br></div><div>Now, onto other matters.</div><div><br></div>Before the hiatus, we ran a contest for fan creations. The entries could be art, prose, photographs, poetry, or anything creative. I'm pleased to say that I've finally selected contest winners. The four winning entries have been placed in our gallery and each will be receiving a Mysteries of the Arcana Devil tarot card. I'm really happy with how the cards turned out and hope our contest winners enjoy them as well.<div><br></div><div>The winners of the contest are:</div><div><br></div><div>*&nbsp;<a href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/?action=gallery&amp;gal=10&amp;pic=282&amp;page=12&amp;begin=0&amp;start=15" class="" classname="" target="_blank" name="">Briela McValan and her musings on the origin of the arcana and the dreamers.</a></div><div><br></div><div>* <a href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/?action=gallery&amp;gal=10&amp;pic=283&amp;page=12&amp;begin=0&amp;start=15" class="" classname="" target="_blank" name="">Dani Katz and a wonderful picture of Theresa.</a></div><div><br></div><div>* <a href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/?action=gallery&amp;gal=10&amp;pic=284&amp;page=12&amp;begin=0&amp;start=15" class="" classname="" target="_blank" name="">James Smith and his parody of chapter one.</a></div><div><br></div><div>* <a href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/?action=gallery&amp;gal=10&amp;pic=285&amp;page=12&amp;begin=0&amp;start=15" class="" classname="" target="_blank" name="">TN Wilson and a lovely poem entitled Destiny.</a></div><div><br></div><div>Each winner will be receiving a Devil card, shown up above, in the mail. I want to thank each of them for entering and everyone for being patient.</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you!</div>
