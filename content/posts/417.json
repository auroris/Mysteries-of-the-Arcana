However, he soldiered on long past when I passed out from exhaustion and delivered the page to my email. It was waiting for me this morning and, thus, I am posting it now. I apologize for it being late.</p><p>We're coming up on the end of chapter 4! There's a few more pages left and then we'll take a break and move onto chapter 5. </p><p>Just a reminder! You can follow Mysteries of the Arcana on <a href=\"http://www.comic-rocket.com/read/mysteries-of-the-arcana/1\" target=\"_blank\">Comic Rocket</a>.
