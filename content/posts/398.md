I'm loving today's page - the result of the disagreement between the Minor and Major Arcana.. For some of you, the page may look familiar. That is because we based the image on<a href="http://www.liechtensteincollections.at/en/pages/artbase_main.asp?module=browse&amp;action=m_work&amp;lang=en&amp;sid=657563308&amp;oid=K-D490280D32F0452699427FAE5A490897" class="" classname="" target="_blank" name=""> Allegory of War as painted by Peter Paul Rubens</a>.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Just a reminder, we won't be updating with another story page until January 2nd. We'll have filler up on Christmas day and on the 30th of December. I promise the filler will be interesting and worth visiting for!</div><div><br></div><div>Now for the fun news! As I've said before, we're going to try to fund the next chapter of Mysteries of the Arcana, chapter 5, via Kickstarter. As you may know, every good Kickstarter campaign has a video and our's will be no exception. Today I'm proud to present a teaser of the video.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ryxdm3KEw7c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span><br></div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>Isn't that amazing? Theresa is played by <a href="http://www.ceciliayus.com/" class="" classname="" target="_blank" name="">Cecilia Yus</a>&nbsp;and Chrystalline is played by Nancy S. Our very own Keith W plays the narrator. All three did amazing work and there will be more of it in the full video when we unveil the Kickstarter next month.</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>In the spirit of the holidays, I've decided to run a little contest. Each of the quotes in the above video come from a page of Mysteries of the Arcana that's already been posted on this site, sometime in our last four years. The first <b><i>four</i></b> people to send me an email and tell me the titles of the pages where each quote came from will get a prototype Theresa Devil tarot card. This contest is open to international readers as well.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Email your contest entry to mysteriesofthearcana (at) gmail (dot) com.</b></div><div><br></div><div>Deadline for the contest is January 2, 2014.</div><div><br></div><div>In the meanwhile, tell me! What did you think of today's page?&nbsp;</div>

<br> Well, that escalated quickly. <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br><br>I think this page works very well. The full color background and change in style, compared to the previous pages, emphasizes the shock associated with war and perhaps the realization that these are personifications of different universes fighting. (or perhaps I�m just reading too much into this)<br><br>If I recall correctly the deaths of the Newcomers are intricately connected to the strange powers that some of the main characters have, I�m looking forward to a more detailed explanation of that in the coming pages.<br>
