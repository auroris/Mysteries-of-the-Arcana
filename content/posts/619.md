<br> I can understand that taking away another life is a moral dilemma, but remembering the words of a police officer I've talked with, the moment you hesitate to pull the trigger will be the moment that people will get hurt. And people getting hurt because you hesitated is a bigger burden than taking away a life that's threatening others.<br><br>In other words, it's going to hurt.<br><br><br>
