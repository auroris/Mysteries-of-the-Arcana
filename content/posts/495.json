Trust me, cybernetic dismemberment and gore is best left to your fertile imaginations. Also, Keith charges me extra for splatterpunk (I'm kidding).</p><p>One of our clever readers noticed the similarities of our cyberspace setting to Shadowrun. Indeed. I am a big fan of cyberpunk being CYBERPUNK. My limbs are chrome, my cyberspace is geometric and neon and you jack straight into your head. No wifi. No bioware. No super high resolution, indistinguishable from reality cyberspace. :)</p><p>As we begin moving towards the end of chapter 5, Keith and I are firming up plans and codes and sites for Royal Road Studios, our umbrella organizations that'll include Mysteries of the Arcana, Silver City and any other projects we might embark on down the road. Please stay tuned for further information.</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>",
