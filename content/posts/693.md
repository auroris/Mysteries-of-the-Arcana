       <p>And here we are on the 2nd day of 2017! The new page is up and we find out more about the curse. I think it is obvious our current storyline is inspired heavily by the story of Beauty and the Beast. However, unlike the animated objects in the Disney movie, here our animated objects were ALWAYS animated objects. Their curse isn't their state of being but being enslaved to serve the fuzzy bastard for life.</p><p>This is all taking place in the Eight of Swords, by the way, an arcana where everyone is cursed in some way.</p><p>What will Mandrake do?!?</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>
