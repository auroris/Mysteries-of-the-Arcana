I believe this puts us just about halfway through chapter 6. I suppose I should start writing chapter 7. After all, those people who backed the Patron for MotA have been kind enough to pay for it!

Don't forget, you have a chance to contribute to Keith's Christmas present. For every commission he gets this month from an MotA reader, I'll be paying him an extra $1. I'm hoping to be able to give him a nice bonus at the end of this month! Contact Keith for more information. There's a nifty button for going to his commission page to our right.

In other news, wave 2 of LEGO Dimensions is out! I picked up my Doctor Who level pack today. So, I now have:

* Batman
* Wildstyle
* Gandalf the Grey
* The Batmobile
* Marty McFly
* The Delorean Time Machine
* The Back to the Future Hoverboard
* Chell from Portal 2
* A Companion Cube
* A Turret
* The Twelfth Doctor
* The TARDIS
* K-9

I'm pretty pleased so far!
