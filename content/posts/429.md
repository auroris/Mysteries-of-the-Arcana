<p>How do you know the webcomic we're promoting today is awesome? I backed it via Kickstarter. And if you can't take my willingness to give money to someone as a recommendation, what can you take? </p><p>Seriously, <a href="https://www.comic-rocket.com/explore/sombulus/" target="_blank">Sombulus</a> is one of the few webcomics out there besides MotA with a multidimensional theme. What happens when a paladin, a sort of demon, and an inventor roam the dimensions using a vehicle that runs on nonsense? AWESOME! That's what happens. Give it a try!</p><p>Also, I'm playing Pokemon X. There's no real reason for me to tell you that except I'm enjoying it a great deal. My current line-up is Florges, Mawile and Vivillon. I have a feeling I'll be adding to that once I start being able to catch Ghost types. </p>
