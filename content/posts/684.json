She was originally supposed to be something of a support character - there to help the plot move along and serve drinks in the background.</p><p>How little I knew. It became obvious, the minute I put her on the page, how essential she was to the story and how amazing she was as a character. Readers responded to her and I responded to her as well. I knew we'd see much more of her.</p><p>Mandrake hasn't gotten the screen time given to Chrys and Theresa but I feel like, along with William, she's the strongest of the secondary characters. If this were a television show, she'd have title credits, absolutely.</p><p>What do you think of Mandrake?</p><p>See you Monday!</p>",
