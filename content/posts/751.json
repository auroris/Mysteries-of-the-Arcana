At the same time, I also wanted to do something a little different, and lean more toward a collage, instead of just a group \"pic\". Honestly, I really do enjoy how this sketch came out, and let me pose a fun question!</p><p>Up to this point (not counting The Last Jedi), what has been your favorite Star Wars film thus far?</p><p>Mine is still very very much Empire.</p>",
