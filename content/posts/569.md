<p>And, as promised, here's the third update of the week. Next week we go back to our regular schedule of M and Th updates. </p><p>The viquirrels are coming, folks!</p><p>So, what did you think of Apple's new product roll out? We've got a new phone that's sort of like the old phone. A new TV product that is sort of neat. And the Apple iPad (Surface) Pro. I do appreciate that Apple is realizing they can't just cling to Steve Jobs' vision forever but none of these were wowing me. </p>
