<p>Single panel pages like this are, I admit, something of an indulgence. They give the writer a bit of a break and let the artist draw something at a scale that doesn't cramp their hands so much, trying to fit tons of details inside a teeny tiny panel.</p><p>Still, Hacker and Sniper are looking pretty damn badass there. </p><p>ManoftheSea: Keith's a veteran, so I'll let him explain his choices when it comes to how much finger Sniper puts on her trigger. Though I suspect he'll blame the horrible cold he's been stuffed up with for two weeks now...</p>

<br> Thanks for the direct response in the blurb!
<br>
<br>Honestly, I figured as much, that it was better for art than realism.  Thanks for making the comic!

<br> Is this before or after Baron Sir's raid?
