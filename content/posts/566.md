<p>Why haiku?</p><p>1. Theresa's terrible at rhyming. She'd try to rhyme blue with pool or something.</p><p>2. A haiku is short. You can make one up quickly and she wants it over with.</p><p>3. She learned how to write haiku back in elementary school, which is pretty much the extent of her poetry education. Theresa just isn't the literary sort.</p><p>Now!</p><p>I want YOU to write a haiku about Mysteries of the Arcana! If I get ten haikus (by ten different readers) in the comment section by Monday I'll release an extra page next week!</p><p>Go to it!</p>
