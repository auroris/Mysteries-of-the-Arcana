Originally I wanted to spread this across two pages but first there was snow and then there was more snow and now there's some snow so... yeah. Snow.</p><p>Also, a bit of real life and a few actual paying writing gigs that I'll be announcing at some point in the future!</p><p>Our new update schedule will be Wednesday. We'll be updating the site to reflect that, of course. Each Wednesday you'll be seeing a new page of chapter 6, starting the 4th. Folk who are supporting us at the right pledge level (or above) over on Patreon will get to see the pages a day or two early!</p><p>I've also got a surprise for everyone next week that's kinda neat. I hope you'll like it.</p><p>So! See you next Wednesday for the first page of Chapter 6: Void in the Road!</p>",
