If that's what happens when Theresa kisses someone, Chrys is lucky she got off with just getting yelled at!<br><br>On a more serious note, if any readers happen to be in the mid-Hudson Valley area and are searching for an RPG group to join, I'm trying to get one together to play Changeling the Dreaming. Contact me if you're nearby and interested! <br>

<br> ...the hell???&nbsp; Why is the horror melting; did I miss a page somewhere?<br>

<br> @Psuedo, it's because the "horror's" weak point was being kissed, apparently by another girl, and 50s sitcoms didn't have gay/lesbian lovers. <img alt=" Wink " src="//smilies/wink1.gif" border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2"><br>

<br>How did Theresa suddenly get williams sword? she did't have it with her in the last 2 shots..Or did she also tame a black hole?Anyway, love the page! Explains why Williams race never wiped them out! i mean, not even in our military can convince ppl to kiss their enemies to kill them!!&nbsp;

<br> i agree with weertangel. how the heck did theresa get william's sword? did he throw it to her? cause last i checked <em>he</em> was using it, u know, fighting mr. ken?

<br> Last time we saw William he got hit by Ken's racket and dropped his sword. Next panel the hilt is next to a human-looking hand, and in the first panel of the next page Theresa is sitting on the ground, holding the hilt in her left hand. Don't ask me how the sword/hilt flew all the way to her, but apparently that's what happened.

<br> Aww, I live pretty close to Hudson Valley, but am in college now, and thus too far away.&nbsp; I has the sads.&nbsp; :'(<br><br>I'm just curious as to how Theresa is able to wield the black-hole sword without it going berserk.&nbsp; Doesn't William have to work really hard to keep it under control?<br>
