To remind everyone, at the end of chapter 1, Theresa did a little sky diving without a parachute and was only saved from going splat because of some trickery involving opening the door to the Royal Road. Even still, she ended up with both legs broken and was in a chair. She refused Blue's help because the idea of laying around in a sentient pile of goo just didn't appeal to her. Wonder why?</p><p>Obviously, some time has passed. There are healing techniques available at the Inn that accelerate healing so she didn't spend nearly as much time in the chair as she could have. I'd say this is roughly a month after the end of Chapter 1 and, obviously, no one goes down to that abandoned subway station often.</p><p>There will be a new comic on the 4th of July even though I live in the States. </p><p>See you Monday!</p>",
