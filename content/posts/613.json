  "text": "<p>Sorry the page is a day late. First I got sent the wrong file and then there were some nasty colds running around the house.</p><p>Things are starting to happen! Mister Mist and Mister Eerie don't seem at all happy about the sudden end to the viquirrel war. I wonder what happens next? Well, I don't wonder. I wrote the script. I hope, however, that YOU wonder...</p><p>Last week I asked everyone what their favorite and least favorite chapters were. I got a nice number of responses.</p><p>Aleena loved <strong>chapter 4</strong> because of the world building. <strong>Chapter 6</strong>, our current chapter, is her least favorite because of the pacing.</p><p>Laura, on the other hand, loves <strong>chapter 6</strong> because Theresa and Chrys's relationship is progressing (and the hedges wanted to bone each other) while she thought <strong>chapter 5</strong> had problems with characterization, especially in the final scene with Ruby.</p><p>KFox wasn't fond of <strong>chapter 4</strong>. He liked it but felt if broke the flow of the story. He was fond of seeing buff guys in <strong>chapters 1, 5, and 6</strong> though!</p><p>Fairportfan felt <strong>chapter 2</strong> gave a good explanation as to why a solid Catholic like Theresa was contemplating suicide while <strong>chapter 5</strong> spent too much time on plot and not enough time on characterization.</p><p>Dave Robinson also felt <strong>chapter 4</strong> broke the pacing of the comic so far. He loved <strong>chapter 1</strong> because it introduced everyone and made him truly care about them.</p><p>JD had a hard time picking but went with <strong>chapter 3</strong> because of the sheer variety. There was no least favorite chapter but JD wasn't fond of us going on hiatus.</p><p>Adamas liked Chrys's character development in <strong>chapter 3</strong>. Also, the sheer amount of Mandrake! No least favorite listed there.</p><p>Six couldn't pick a favorite or least favorite because the whole story seems connected. Which it is!</p><p>Peaches agreed!</p><p>Mythress gave a nice analysis of multiple chapters but eventually picked chapter 6 for multiple reasons. <strong>Chapter 6</strong> is picking up the overall storyline of the comic, she feels, and because of the balance of the whimsical and creepy. <strong>Chapter 4</strong> is her least favorite because, come on, Theresa in a strappy dress? Where's she gonna put the gun?</p><p>Seth thought <strong>chapter 4</strong> was the low point. He's not particularly fond of info-dumps. For favorite, he was leaning toward <strong>chapter 3</strong> because of lots of Mandrake!</p><p>Gunsolo, everyone's favorite island-dwelling lizard, picked <strong>chapter 1</strong> and <strong>chapter 4</strong> as tied for favorite. There was world building and origins! <strong>Chapter 5</strong> was his least favorite because he felt the motivations of the intruders and their patron were unclear. Don't worry, Gunsolo! <strong>Chapter 7</strong> will follow-up and explain that more!</p><p>SelenticSurface, on the other hand, liked <strong>chapter 5</strong> because we had emotional complications, heroics, and foreshadowing. <strong>Chapter 4</strong>, on the other hand, seemed to go on forever (and the hiatus didn't help).</p><p>Lukkai, meanwhile had a hard time picking. <strong>Chapter 5 </strong>came out on top but <strong>chapter 2</strong> was a close second place. He felt there was some lovely character development in both. He couldn't name a least favorite.</p><p>And that's a summary of thoughts from some of our loyal readers. Thank you for responding!</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>",
