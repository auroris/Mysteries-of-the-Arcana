So, we're preparing a print edition of Mysteries of the Arcana. I have two questions. How many people are sincerely interested in such (by which, I mean, how many of you would dedicate some hard earned cash to it) and what do you consider to be a fair price? It will be at least $15.00. Would you consider that fair? Or would it be worth $18 or $20? The book will likely be softcover and contain our first storyline (some 60 or so, double sided color pages) along with some bonus material (some art by Keith and possibly a story by me explaining the origin of the arcana).<br><br>Everyone who is interested, please respond. I'd like to get some rough sort of head count. Thank you!<br>

Brillent idea!&nbsp; Although long over due.&nbsp; First edition definately should go for $20.&nbsp;$5 extra for autographs by&nbsp;Jgrey, Keith, and JD.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'd love to help donate but I am raising children on one income, so while my children and I&nbsp;enjoy the comic beyound belief I can not at this time finacially support.&nbsp; But if you guys should wish to donate an autographed edition to Keith's three biggest fans, just let me know!&nbsp;By the way, I'm loving the action in this page.&nbsp; Of course Theresa shoots first!&nbsp; It's worked so far, but like I said before, goo is notoriously impossible to destroy.&nbsp; Maybe she should try wacking it with a sword, it works in D&amp;D. *shrug*&nbsp;<br><br>

<br> I'd pay something between $15-20 for a book, especially if all of the pages are full-color.&nbsp; It just really depends on when the book would be available, since my finances are going to be up in the air for the next few months.&nbsp; I also promised the artist of the Pon&amp;Zi images that I'd by a buy shirt from him as soon as they were made available again.<br>

<br> That goo looks awfully phallic up there, chasing our intrepid lesbian.<br>

<br> I'd also pay somewhere between $15 and $20 for a full color book.<br>

<br> Oh shite! the goo is immune to bullets, maybe some hand to hand combat might affect it. <br>As for the print comic. I'll definitely be picking up the comic when u guys get it printed. 15-20$ sounds fair, looking forward to seeing what extras youre going to be putting in there.<br><br>

<br>First, the page, it really looks cool! i was expecting something like this anyway hehe, also, is that blood on teresa's chin or did she suddenly grow a goatee?(don't ask me how..)as for the comic print, sure! i think the prices u guys said are fair(it like 3-5$ cheaper for me since we use Euro's here.) and&nbsp;since its in full color i''ll definitly want it!&nbsp; on will have to see when i got the cash for it, since getting 1 book from the&nbsp;other side of the world to here is quite costly unless buy more then 1 thing. and i have been spending a little to much i think lately on novels and manga's (i'm addicted, sue me..) but i will get it!PS: could u show us the cover of the print whenever u have it ready?? would be cool <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">&nbsp;

I have it!&nbsp; I know what Theresa should do!&nbsp; She need some<font face="Calibri"><font face="Arial">Nitroglycerine&nbsp; so she can freeze the goo and then shove it off the turtle and into the water so it can sink into the deepths of the sea and then know one will ever know how she's connected with Debbie's death!&nbsp; Mwahahaha, take that truth goo!</font></font><br><br>

<br> I would absolutely buy a $15-$20 print of the comic! I like the signed edition idea a lot, too. I love the comic!

<br> I consider $15-20 quite a fair price for a full-colour compilation, and would certainly consider buying one. This is a very interesting comic <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br>

Thanks, everyone. I really appreciate the feedback. And the ideas. I don't think Theresa has a handy supply of nitroglycerin on her, however...<br><br><br>
