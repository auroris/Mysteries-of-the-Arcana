No worries, though, there'll be content offered during that time. Half the websites on the internet seem to be offering a top ten games of the year so I don't plan on adding to the traffic. Instead, I'll be presenting the top ten female characters in video games.... from games I played this year. Which will include old games (I tend to replay games or buy them later in their lifetime) as well as newer games.",
