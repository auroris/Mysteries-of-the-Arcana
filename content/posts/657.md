<p>As our story here continues, poor Mandrake seems to be in a bit of a bind! What will happen to her? Will the goblins eat her? </p><p>So every knows, our next story will involve none of our regular cast but will instead be a seven to ten page adventure staring a certain elf and a certain gunslinger who showed up back in chapter 5...</p><p>See everyone Monday!</p>
