<p>It has been years since we last saw the inside of Chrys's bedroom. Theresa's sitting on the forcefield bed and you can see the spray painted graffiti dreamwalker sigils on the pink walls. There's also the edge of Chrys's rolltop desk in panel 3.</p><p>I can't take any real credit here, though. Keith remembered all the details and made sure they fit it.</p><p>So, where do you think they'll be going? There's a no-prize for anyone who guesses correctly!</p>

<br> Roundabout way to enter the 4 of cups is my guess. Anyone after Dreamwalkers would know the entry points to any Arcana they'd follow them to and probably have ambushes waiting.<br>

<br> Not to be a pain, but what happened to Bricks? I kinda liked those. Thought they were going to be on Sundays.<br>
