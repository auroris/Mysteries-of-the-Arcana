Don't forget, if you subscribed to the RSS feed before the beginning of this storyline, you need to resubscribe. The old feed no longer works. I apologize for the inconvenience.<br><br>I wonder what Theresa's quest is going to be...<br>

<br> In the turtle speech, trod should be tread - unless the turtle has a strange view of time? Which is possible...

I'm sorry to let you down, Wert. No amazon tribe living on the back of the giant turtle.<br><br>Celtie, you're correct. The turtle does have a strange sense of time, something that will become important. Eventually. Though maybe not in this storyline.<br><br><br>
