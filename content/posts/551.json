You reach it using one of those neat little elevators that shops in cities use to transfer goods from the sidewalk down into their storeroom. Chrys is using it to leave now.</p><p>To continue my cellphone story from Monday, it turns out there's nothing I can do to get this phone on my network. It just isn't happening, which is a shame. I can't transfer out to another network, though, because that would require getting a new plan and my grandfathered old plan is amazingly nice. Unlimited phone and data for fairly cheap. Not that I use the data much on my antique smartphone, sadly.</p><p>See everyone Monday!</p>",
