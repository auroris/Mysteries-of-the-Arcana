Hopefully, as time marches on, that'll change.</p><p>Keith has asked me to inform everyone about a Kickstarter being held to raise funds for a Starship Moonhawk audio drama. He's heavily involved as producer and director. His band (did you know he has a band) is also producing the music. You can find <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/starship-moonhawk-the-death-of-perseus-audiobook\" target=\"_blank\">more information here.</a></p><p>There'll be a new Bricks of the Arcana on Friday and a new story comic next Wednesday.</p><p>See you then!</p>",
