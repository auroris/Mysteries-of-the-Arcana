<p>We're one day closer to the debut of chapter 5! Today we're spotlighting <a href="https://www.comic-rocket.com/explore/lasalles-legacy/" target="_blank">LaSalle's Legacy</a>. This comic's got pirates. It has zombies. It has pirate zombies!</p><p>Yes. Pirate zombies.</p><p>Translation: why aren't you already reading it?</p><p>Keith's been showing me some character design sketches for the new folk who will be showing up in chapter 5. Want to see one? Here's Aleena. If you recognize her name that's because she's a regular reader of MotA. Her appearance as a bad guy in the chapter was her reward for generously supporting our Kickstarter.</p><p><img src="/pics/c9fa291efc46af23a014e2034c628c9c.jpg"></p><p>See you tomorrow!</p>

<br> Wow, this really reminds me of Monkey Island. Though by the description it seems to be more drama than humour.<br>
