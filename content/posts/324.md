Gennifer is moved in and unpacking. She sent along this full color version of the previous page, so we're moving along! Hopefully, next week, we'll be back to normal!<br><br>In the meanwhile, may I suggest a podcast? Gennifer appeared on <a name="" target="_blank" classname="" class="" href="http://urbanotakucleveland.blogspot.com/2011/09/urban-otaku-podcast-7-shit-list-with.html">Urban Otaku</a> as a guest. She talked about Mysteries of the Arcana, art, and anime. It was a fun time! Warning, though, there is some language so you probably don't want to listen to it outloud at work or around small children.<br><br>Lastly, I want to send a belated thanks to a special reader. Someone was very kind and, about a month ago, donated one hundred dollars to the comic. That helped pay for the art and kept us going. I won't say who because I don't know if that person wants the publicity but they know who they are. Thank you!<br>

<br> Is that Vitamin X in the bottles?
<br>
<br>Also: We know what they need the Vitamin X for.  What do they need the goat-frog's bezoar for?
