<p>More than one of you predicted that Mister Mist and Mister Eerie, hereby known as Mister Misteerie, were in fact the same person. How right you were. Just maybe not in the way you thought! Things just got a little stranger in the Hanged Man.</p><p>So, here I am, working on the next chapter. In some ways, it will be a follow-up on chapter 5 as the team seeks more information about why Baron Sir and his lackies invaded the Inn. At least part of it will take place on the Moon, Mandrake's home arcana. I'm taking some inspiration from heist shows/movies such as Leverage and Ocean's 11.</p><p>My question to you? What would you, the reading audience of Mysteries of the Arcana. like to see in chapter seven?  Nothing's out of bounds yet. Let me know. Side note, Chrys and Theresa will both be turning eighteen between this chapter and the next.</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>

<br> I feel like the side note makes your question about Ch7 a leading question ;P<br>

<br>Yeah. &nbsp;Do not attack the GF of a young woman with a nine millimeter in hand.============Turning eighteen, huh?More lesbian elf kisses?

<br> Oddly enough, how about meeting Mandrake's parents just for the giggle factor. (And that would just so HAPPEN to mean a high probability of more Mandrake)<br>

<br> Hard to say what should come next, when I'm not sure yet how this is going to resolve, but <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">&nbsp; I loved Leverage -- going to the Moon would be pulling off an inverted White Rabbit?&nbsp; Should be great fun!&nbsp; Would Surgeon's cyberspace (like we saw in Ch 5) be just as susceptible to shifting illusion, or immune somehow?<br>

<br>Would be nice to see something that deepens their relationship even more.&nbsp;Mainly thinking they'd learn even more about each other but I suppose some cute snuggling wouldn't be bad either.

<br> See at least one well-meant, but totally inappropriate (funnily so, for us readers at least) birthday present and Theresa and/or Chrys fussing over it.<br><br>Double points if the one fussing over it is teased by the other about it.<br>
