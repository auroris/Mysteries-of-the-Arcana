Well, you might if you are doing individual shots but for their intended function of providing bursts, you need to brace them against your shoulder like a rifle. If you look up this, you fill find that even deliberately very small SMGs like the micro-uzi have foldable or collapsable/extendable/etc stock (or just plain stocks). Or something to hold it two-handed. Not a problem of course if she doesn't need to hit anything (suppressing fire)."
