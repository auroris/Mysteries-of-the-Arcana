I know. I know. Some of you want to continue to follow the story of Theresa and William. On the other hand, I hope some of you are glad to return to the story of Chrys and Mandrake. There's some pretty fun stuff coming up, so stick with us, please!<br>

What doesn't kill us (like the suspense) will only make us stronger..... or cause a small riot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Torture away!&nbsp; Everyone seems to love it.&nbsp; *mutters* sadistic bastards.<br><br>

<br>I like Chrys and Mandrake so I don't mind too much personally <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">Considering the state of the escape pod, I think they are rather fortunate to have actually landed somewhere while still being alive. An hostile desert is better than deep space! I guess the pod actually was worth the 5 credits. Plus, there's a metal building-like thingy in the background, which is habited by peace-loving, gentle occupants, I'm sure.

<br> Emerging from an escape pod that landed in the middle of a vast desert? Why does this seem familiar?

<br> Is it just me or is there a Doctor Who reference in the first panel?<br>

<br> I just wonder if the pictorial language the little one talks is the language of moisture vaporators.&nbsp; Probably gonna need that.<br>
