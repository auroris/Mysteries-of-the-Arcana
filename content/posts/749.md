<p>As promised, a look at the other end of the Inn's business in this possible future. Chrys, running the front bar, and...is that a wedding band I see on her hand?</p><p>I liked putting this idea together, playing on potential changes in the growth of both Chrys and Theresa, things that might change as they got older, glasses, new hairstyles, etc.</p><p>J's still working hard at his day job, and I'm pushing forward with my own other work. And if you guys want to see other places my work is at, check out the following!</p><p><a href="http://www.patreon.com/Keira">http://www.patreon.com/Keira</a></p><p>This is where I put pretty much everything else that's not comic specific! (Some NSFW stuff here, but nothing that can be seen by the passerby, just an fyi.)</p><p><a href="http://www.grrlpowercomic.com">http://www.grrlpowercomic.com</a></p><p>I still color for Dave B. on occasion, and this comic is actually pretty funny.</p><p><a href="http://www.starshipmoonhawk.com">http://www.starshipmoonhawk.com</a></p><p>I do a bit of coloring, editing, and occasional drawing here, feel free to add this one to your list as well, (updates are Patreon funded and based)</p><p>See you guys soon!</p>
