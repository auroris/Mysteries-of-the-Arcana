Hello!<div><br></div><div>Here's another update to remind ya'll that we're still alive and getting ready to finish chapter 4. As proof, here are the pencils for a page of chapter 4. Keith's hard at work on the art and we're aiming to get up and running soon.</div><div><br></div><div>I want to thank those who gave suggestions for the Kickstarter. Your ideas are good ones and the links gave me a lot of ideas to work with.</div><div><br></div><div>Now, I have a new question for loyal dreamwalkers! I'm happy to announce that Mysteries of the Arcana will be participating in <a href="http://www.wagonwebcomicbattle.com/cardgame/" class="" classname="" target="_blank" name="">WAGON's Webcomic Battle CCG</a>. There will be six MotA themed cards in their next theme deck. As part of that, I need to provide quotes for each card. I'm having trouble deciding, so I'm asking you, the readers, to help me out. Which quotes from the comic would you put on a card for each of these:</div><div><br></div><div>Chrys</div><div>Theresa</div><div>William</div><div>Mandrake</div><div>William's Sword</div><div>the Royal Road</div><div><br></div><div>I appreciate your input. You are all awesome. Thank you for your patience.</div>
