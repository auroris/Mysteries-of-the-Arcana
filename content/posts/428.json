Today, though, we're spotlighting <a href=\"https://www.comic-rocket.com/explore/missing-monday/\" target=\"_blank\">Missing Monday</a>. This is an LGBT friendly webcomic with beautiful, evocative art. I've added it to my <a href=\"https://www.comic-rocket.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Comic Rocket</a> reading list and you should as well.</p><p>Just for fun, here's another sketch of a character who will be appearing in the next chapter of Mysteries of the Arcana. This is Kietra, another of our backers. She's the second villain cameo.</p><p><img src=\"/pics/9f6334fdf05a550d874780a8d65c361f.jpg\"></p><p>See you tomorrow!</p>",
