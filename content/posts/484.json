All those neat toys yanked off thanks to the now deceased (re-deceased) patchwork twins.</p><p>I'm proud to announce that the <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/user?u=244206\">Patreon campaign for Silver City</a> is going strong! We're up to $61 per page. For those who don't know, Silver City is a new webcomic from Royal Road Studios (aka Keith and I). It is written by me based on Keith's concepts and illustrated by Keith. The idea's pretty simple: a world in which superheroes are new, where powers come with disadvantages and where there's diversity in the population. Eventually, we'll get a website up and running but, for now, pages are being posted over at the Patreon. The first one went up this week and patrons got the first read but we've made it public for all of you to check out, too! Please <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/creation?hid=835154\" target=\"_blank\">read the page</a> and consider backing us. Even $1 per page can make a big difference. Especially since Keith is giving me credit towards future Mysteries of the Arcana chapters based on how much we raise in the Silver City Patreon!</p><p>We have a complicated but fun relationship. :)</p><p>See you Monday!</p>",
