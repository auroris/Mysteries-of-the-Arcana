I'm guessing most of you have, at some point in your life, been behind the scenes at a mall. In the corridors that run behind the stores of the bathrooms in the little used corners. They're never very pretty...<br><br>Dont' forget about the art auction. Keith's auctioning off several pieces of original Mystery of the Arcana comic boards. This is a chance to own part of the comic for a very low price. Details are in the post below!<br>

<br> Wow!&nbsp; How did my last car end up at the mall, and why are they thinking of getting into it?!?!<br>

<br> At this point, I think I would be seriously contemplating just buying the stuff again. (BTW, the dehydrated water blew my mind ... how do you re-hydrate it? &nbsp;With water, I presume - and in that case, why bother having dehydrated water? &nbsp;The mind boggles ...)
