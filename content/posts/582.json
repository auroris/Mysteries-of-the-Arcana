Ahem.</p><p>---</p><p>Play Pathfinder? Tired of your campfire meals being rations and whatever game the ranger can find for you in the woods? May I suggest, <a href=\"http://drivethrurpg.com/product/162315/Letters-from-the-Flaming-Crab-Culinary-Magic\" target=\"_blank\">Letters from the Flaming Crab: Culinary Magic</a>?</p><p>My latest book came out this week and it is pretty cheap. Just $2.99 for a new magic system that lets anyone with Craft (cooking) or Craft (baking) and the right feat produce meals that give small but useful buffs to their whole party. And, of course, when you buy a copy of this I get a small percentage so it is helping me out.</p><p>See you Monday!</p>",
