<p>I have a special place in my heart for webcomics that follow the traditional "adventuring party fantasy" trope but still find a way to break the mold. <a href="https://www.comic-rocket.com/explore/kyria/" target="_blank">Kyria</a> is just such a comic. It satisfies the D&amp;D itch but in ways that are unpredictable and fun. Give it a try!</p><p>I've finished designing the four tarot cards we'll be sending out as part of our Kickstarter rewards. These cards will also be for sale via our soon to debut store. The store should be up and running by the end of spring. Here's a taste of two of the cards:</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/pics/2deb41556a7fbdb736e6ba4b27574259.png" alt="" style="width: 181px;"> <img src="/pics/5104b9d31a4f0d42d8be6f2af0747ab3.png" alt="" style="width: 181px;"></p><p>See y'all tomorrow!</p>
