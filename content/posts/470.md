<p><strong>Hidden Name: </strong>Richard Shaffer</p><hr><p>So, as it was mentioned in the previous page, I was making some slow modifications to my illustration process for the comic, mainly dealing with faces and noses. J and I spoke a bit, and he didn't like the way the larger noses looked, so, here we are, back to small noses for the girls!</p><p>Also, J's with family for the 4th holiday, and he wishes all of you out there, as do I, a happy Fourth of July!</p>
