<p>And we return! Welcome to chapter 8 which, despite previous announcements will likely <strong>not </strong>be the last chapter of <em>Mysteries of the Arcana</em>. As I was laying the chapter out I realize there are still two chapters of the main plot line to be told. </p><p>This chapter will be something of a follow-up to chapter 5, where the Inn was invaded and we caught a glimpse of a <a href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/comics/534/" target="_blank">mysterious dragon</a> who seemed behind it all. Questions left over from that chapter will be answered here.</p><p>You'll remember, as I call them, Hacker and Sniper. We last saw them in chapter 7, when they were engaged in the mass slaughtering of alien pirates and the<a href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/comics/703/" target="_blank"> rescue of Chrys's father</a>, a man who probably didn't actually need rescuing since he has the same abilities as his daughter and a great deal more experience in using them.</p><p>Do you like their new eyes?</p><p>See you Monday!</p>

<br> Given the fact that they came from the void and their eyes look wrong, I take it that they are being possessed.&nbsp; Am I right in thinking that her father is actually on the void's side?<br>
