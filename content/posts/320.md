A splash page is a single panel page that is designed to highlight action or a situation. I tend to use the splash page when I'm showing off a cool move on the part of our heroes, inspiring wonder, or introducing a new concept.<br><br>Or, in this case? A new toy...<br>

<br> I always thought a splash page was the same as a "Cover page"<br>
