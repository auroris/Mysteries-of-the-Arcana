There's a Christmas tree set up and decorated.  There's been a snow day or two for the local schools.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mandrake's heading for the rainy castle, carried along against her will. Why isn't she trying to wiggle free, fight, or escape you might ask? That's just not her style. She's learned a lot since she was a young thief, stealing food in a cyberpunk fantasy land. Now she knows it is best to pick one's battles and wait for the right opportunity.</p><p>Plus, she's enjoying trolling this guy.</p><p>What's on your Christmas game list this year? There's a lot of great new LEGO Dimension sets out!</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>",

Despite having owned an X-Bone for the better part of a year, there's only two discy games I've given any care about for it and I have those already. (Rock Band 4 and Deadpool, btw.) And I done bought Pokï¿½Moon as well."
