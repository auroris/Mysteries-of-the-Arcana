DxelA asked if Kludge and Melody saying "tender" together last page was a reference to the Disney show "Recess". The answer? Absolutely.<br><br>Geek and pop culture references are nothing new in comics, of course. Comics have been making sly (and not so sly) references for decades. Our own comic's done it since the very beginning. If you look hard enough you'll find references to such diverse topics as Kim Possible, 2001, and Keith's girlfriend.<br><br>Interestingly, William's sword is a deliberate attempt not to make a reference. I wanted to make a science fiction sword but NOT a lightsaber, so I went in the opposite direction. Instead of a blade of light, I made a blade of nothing at all.<br>

Please note that JGrey means the current girlfriend.&nbsp; Not to be confused with the really awesome ex one who reads this comic.&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">&nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;SHE does have a lightsaber!<br><br>

<br>Considering just how much pop culture I follow... I'll be missing a whole lot of it!Anyway... Whatever that VitaminXTreme does, it's certainly not helping in making stuff grow over there!

<br> Holy crap, dogboy lives in the Fallout arcana!!! XD Okay no, but it would be awesome to see a guy or a gal wearing the blue "13" vault suit in the background ... you know, that could actualy work. Even the giant ants would fit in just fine.<br>
