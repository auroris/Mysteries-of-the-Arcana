<p>J's still prepping and working through GenCon, so he's a super busy bee. In the meantime, everyone loves some Mandrake, right?</p><p>J suggested some various Mandrake ideas, and this one kinda leapt out at me. The idea of Mandrake handlebar riding on a Harley was just a lot of fun to picture, but I also wanted to showcase some of her more fashionable styles that might go with it. So ta-da. Biker Mandrake.</p><p>Enjoy and we'll see you soon!</p><p>Keith W.</p>
