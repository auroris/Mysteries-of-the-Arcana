<br> Called it. <img alt=" Smile " src=" /smilies/smile.gif " border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2"><br>It's about time that happened. <br>Real-world time that is, not neccesarily comic-time. :p <br><br>I wonder why it's so common for this to happen in stories at critical times, as if the protagonist didn't have enough on his/her mind what with being in mortal danger, now you dump all those romantic feelings and thoughts on top of it as well.<br>
