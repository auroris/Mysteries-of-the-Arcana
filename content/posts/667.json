They give the writer a bit of a break and let the artist draw something at a scale that doesn't cramp their hands so much, trying to fit tons of details inside a teeny tiny panel.</p><p>Still, Hacker and Sniper are looking pretty damn badass there. </p><p>ManoftheSea: Keith's a veteran, so I'll let him explain his choices when it comes to how much finger Sniper puts on her trigger. Though I suspect he'll blame the horrible cold he's been stuffed up with for two weeks now...</p>",
