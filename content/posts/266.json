Originally, my intent was to follow chapter 3 with a chapter devoted to exploring Chrys and Theresa's relationship. Instead, I've decided that the origin story on the arcana themselves needs to be explored. It is time ya'll got a chance to learn it. So, next chapter?<br><br>THE ORIGIN OF EVERYTHING!<br><br>The title's a work in progress.",
