<p>It's always fun working on cameos for the comic, especially when they aren't scripted and I have to think up a fun way to sneak a character into a scene.</p><p>Our final cameo for this chapter is Sean J. Mnoholitny. He's apparently on his own little mission looking for something in Quest's cache, or a few somethings since he's got a list, but the girls are so preoccupied with their own agenda they don't even realize he's there!</p><p>Hope you guys are enjoying this chapter so far, and we'll see you back here on Monday!</p><p>Keith W.</p>

<br> I'm not sure I understand the reasoning behind the guy wandering around behind the girls. Even as a cameo, doesn't this mean you are going to have to explain his presence there? He has to figure into the story somehow, otherwise when someone reads this without the commentary it won't make any sense, like, oh this random guy is wandering around in Crys's dad's secret, magically hidden underground vault with a list.
