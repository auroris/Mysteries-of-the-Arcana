<p>Today's page gets posted on that rarest of dates...</p><p>My birthday!</p><p>Today I am 40 years old. </p><p>Yep.</p><p>If you're interested in giving me a present, please consider supporting Mysteries of the Arcana <a href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=452395" target="_blank">via Patreon</a> or, if you are a Pathfinder player, buying a copy of Letters from the <a href="http://drivethrurpg.com/product/150489/Letters-from-the-Flaming-Crab-Winged-Cavalry" target="_blank">Flaming Crab: Winged Cavalry</a> (I have ongoing royalties for that one so I get a percentage of each sale) or even Mysteries of the Arcana volume <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mysteries-Arcana-Chapter-Heavens-Earths-ebook/dp/B00S7LB620/" target="_blank">1</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mysteries-Arcana-chapter-All-Down-ebook/dp/B00S6ZTYDA/" target="_blank">2</a>! </p><p>Or, if you want to go the non-material route, leave me a happy birthday comment. I like comments. They make the comic look loved. Comics with no comments feel sad and lonely.</p><p>See you Monday!</p>
