<p>Things are still pretty hectic around the RR offices, so sorry for the late update.</p><p>Also you guys, don't forget to check out and support our top Ad Sponsor, Chance Raspberry. I've had the privilege of meeting the man, and he's totally amazing, and worth a look. Part of the Simpsons animation team and also a musician, he's incredibly talented and very down to earth. His Little Billy project above helps promote awareness for special needs children, and is definitely worth a look, and support.</p><p>If you're ad blocked or click impaired for the image, here's the link to the Little Billy Patreon page.</p><p>https://www.patreon.com/littlebilly?ty=h</p><p>See you guys on Thursday!</p>
