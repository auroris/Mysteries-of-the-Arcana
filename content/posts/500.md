Keith has a touch of the plague (or, you know, the flu) so wasn't up for making today's page. Instead, we've got a bit of gift art from Peggy Wolohan von Burkleo. A special thanks to Peggy, who whipped this up at the last minute.

If you're interested, you can go visit Peggy's webcomic, Samhain Night: A Dark Faerie Tale. It is one of the most gorgeous comics out there, I think. Beautiful textures and a wonderful understanding of celtic mythology.

See you Monday!
