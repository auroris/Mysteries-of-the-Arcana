Kludge and Melody get to go to the spa.<br><br>Chrys and Mandrake get to go to the mall.<br><br>And Theresa and William? They get to get eaten by a goat-frog.<br><br>Sometimes, there's no justice in the world.<br>

<br>Well, if you look at it the other way...The other two teams have to actually buy stuff. Theresa can get her stuff for free!&nbsp;Well, at least the frog thingy... So since I doubt Theresa has a lot of money, she lucked out on her list!And yay, first clean shot of post-surgeon Melody!
