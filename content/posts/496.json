It continue the storyline of Persona 4 Arena which is a canonical sequel to both Persona 3 and Persona 4. Rumor has it, this game even sets up Persona 5. Psyched! The game came with ten tarot cards, too! How neat is that?</p><p>Second, Gotham Academy came out. I cannot tell you how excited I was for this comic. I haven't bought a DC book in years but this? This I went out and got day one. It is about a group of kids going to the exclusive Gotham Academy, Bruce Wayne's alma-mater. The designs are gorgeous, the writing happily geeky, and the first book set the pace perfectly. I can't remember the last time I thought a 22 page comic book was actually long enough to tell an effective story. </p><p>Seriously. Buy it. Support this book, please. I want more.</p><p>See you Monday!</p>",
