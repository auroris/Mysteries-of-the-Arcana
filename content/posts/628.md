<p>So, things are still hectic, but I figure perhaps we should talk about the story, no? Isn't that what comic creators do? Talk about their product? </p><p>When I go to conventions, I can ramble on about MotA to any stranger as they walk by my table, and take a card, hoping they drop in to see the story and stick around, but something about this text box always makes my mind go blank and all I can think to do is say something quirky and be all, "Nice page, pretty, yes?"</p><p>Anyway, see you guys on Thursday, along with one more cameo!</p><p>Keith W.</p>

<br> You could always check Dan Shive's comic comments on El Goonish Shive for reference. <img src="//smilies/wink1.gif" alt="Wink" border="0"> <br>

<br> Yes, very pretty. <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br><br>I couldn't help but notice that Theresa just put the Power Glove on her left hand, but when she picked it up two pages ago it was a right-handed glove. Unless this is some kind of magic morphing glove, I think the easiest fix would be to move the thumb over when she first saw it.<br>
