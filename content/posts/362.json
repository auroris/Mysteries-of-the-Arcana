The outfit is somewhat 80s inspired, I admit. <br><br>In the extras section you can now find a link to Mysteries of the Arcana's first fanfiction! A while back Ayshara was kind enough to write a MotA inspired drabble. It took me a while but I finally linked to it. It is front and center, first thing, when you click on the extras button.<br><br>See you at the end of the week!",
