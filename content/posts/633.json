Not sure when J's planning to tally the entries and pick a winner, but til he offers a formal closing date, keep firing off suggestions.</p><p>Interestingly, this page was altered from the script. After reading the script, I posed an alternate way to play out the events, and J liked my idea enough that we decided to go with it instead.</p><p>In the script, Theresa doesn't clear the chamber, she loads the new clip and fires two shots, instead of one. I suggested having her remove the clip and the glove at the same time, so I could have her clear the slide before putting in the sigiled clip.</p>",
