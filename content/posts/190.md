       Hokey dokey. Where to start.<div><br></div><div>First, a slight apology for taking a bit longer than expected to produce this. A fresh install of PS is never a kind thing to try and work expeditiously with.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Anywho, the box is up and running at 110% (I add that extra 10% because it's better than what I had). So, first off, many thanks go out to our readers, and of course our big donor that helped me get the parts I needed to repair my box.</div><div><br></div><div>And lastly, this page is actually probably one of the most detailed I've done since I started working on MotA. It'll make more sense once it's colored, which will be a "get it done asap" in my department here. From here onward, things should be back to normal!</div><div><br></div><div>Once again, thanks to everyone for your continued support, both J and I appreciate it greatly.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Regards,</div><div>Keith W.</div>
