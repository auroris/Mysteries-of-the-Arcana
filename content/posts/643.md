<p>So, on Monday, I got to go spend time with a friend I hadn't seen in a while, and meet his new lady. One thing that he and I tend to get all side-tracked on is RPG talk, and we wound up once again, wilding our ways off into discussions of the various game systems and their mechanics.</p><p>Personally, I'm a fan of D&amp;D 3.5 and Pathfinder, and he's a hardcore Rolemaster buff.</p><p>What game systems do you guys enjoy?</p>

<br> Running systems straight has <i>not</i> been a thing in my extended group over the years, so since starting days of D&amp;D Greyhawk, <i>etc</i>, I've run games with versions of :<br><br>- Runequest 2<br>- Fudge,<br>- Risus,<br>- Fate<br><br>all variously customised, and some pure homebrews now long lost<br><br><br>

<br> I'm a pathfinder mostly guy myself. Although I do want to try GURPS or Warhammer 40k rp.

<br>I LIKE Chrys's new look.Looks like something that would be simple to slide into or out of ... or off."What a lovely new outfit. &nbsp;I'd love to help you put it back on."
