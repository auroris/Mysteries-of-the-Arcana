<p><strong>Hidden Name</strong>: Adamas</p><hr><p><a href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/comics/10/" target="_blank">Dreamwalking</a></p><p>This comes about because, in my original outline I did intend for them to use the Beast to smash through the front entrance of the Inn. However, the more I thought about it, the more I thought I should use a method that already existed in the MotA universe. We haven't seen a dreamwalk in quite some time, after all, and it is a central aspect of Chrys's character. Remember, dreamwalking is different from walking the Royal Road. Any key can use the Royal Road but only Dreamers (Chrys and her dad) can dreamwalk.</p><p>See y'all Thursday!</p>

<br> Admitedly the whole "Someone is Hunting Dreamwalkers" thing does put a damper on it. Kinda like firing a magnesium flare when you're supposed to be sneaking in.<br>

<br> It'll be cool to see the dreamwalking again, but what I really want to find out about is spell on the girls' noses. They've been growing slowly but steadily larger and more bulbous as the chapter has progressed--too consistently to be an accident. I'm wondering what sort of spell the Baron cast that would cause this and how it is going to tie into the storyline.&nbsp;

<br> Yeeeah... Dreamwalking does not sound like a safe move right now, what with someone hunting the dreamers.<br><br>It is better than ramming the gate with the beast though, as that option might mean that I would fall off the hood. <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br>
