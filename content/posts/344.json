Thank you!<br><br>As a reminder, I'll be running a 'Q&amp;A' series when this storyline is over. This is the sort of thing they do regularly over at EGS and Doonesberry. I thought I'd give it a try as well. However, it won't work well if I don't have questions! I have quite a few but all from a single reader. I'd like some represented diversity. Have a question about how the arcana work? How key powers work? Character history? Let me know! Email questions to mysteriesofthearcana@gmail.com. Alternatively, those of you on twitter can send a private message to JGrayWebcomic.<br><br>Thanks!",
