They tied Kludge up in duct tape. Like duct tape would ever betray him. Duct tape loves Kludge! Not to mention he's a dead-on shot with the makeshift rubber band slingshot.</p><p>And so begins one of the longest action sequences I've ever written. I had a lot of fun plotting it out. There may have been miniatures involved.</p><p>Okay! I'm taking odds and predictions. How do you, dear reader, think the fight is going to go?</p>",

It's more likely that someone (Kludge, since he's closest) will use one of the detached limbs as an improvised weapon."
