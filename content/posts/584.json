I have no idea how well celebrated the holiday is outside of the US (where we've turned it into a commercial cash cow filled with candy sales and amazingly short skirts made out of flimsy artificial fabrics) but I thought I'd offer everyone a happy ghouls and ghosts day anyway.</p><p>Looks like Chrys has managed to implement plan B. Now, if only the other viquirrel clan will be receptive. Surely, they're more reasonable than the greys, right?</p><p>Right?</p><p>How many of you have read the new Jim Butcher novel? The steampunk one that's starting a new series. Without spoiling it, what did you think? We just grabbed it from the library but my dear wife gets first crack at it.</p>",
