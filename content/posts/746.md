<p>After all the fun and cutesy things, I thought it might be fun to see Chrys and Theresa in a more badass state, ready to take on anything.</p><p>On a separate note, things are well. The other half is recuperating, we've had the surgery and first post-op follow-up, and it all looks to be good. I'll keep you guys posted, and hope everyone has an epic holiday.</p>

<br> Best wishes for your other half's recovery!<br><br>The picture is pretty cool. <br><br>I do also have to leave a bit of criticism: you can't really use an SMG one-handed. Well, you might if you are doing individual shots but for their intended function of providing bursts, you need to brace them against your shoulder like a rifle. If you look up this, you fill find that even deliberately very small SMGs like the micro-uzi have foldable or collapsable/extendable/etc stock (or just plain stocks). Or something to hold it two-handed. Not a problem of course if she doesn't need to hit anything (suppressing fire).<br>
