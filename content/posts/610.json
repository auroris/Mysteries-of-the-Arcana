The word of power obtained from the oddly erotic Garden of Epic Manly Poetry was, in fact, a way to grow the trees.</p><p>Except, these are trees growing on a world that's one giant tree. I suppose that makes them branches? Think about that for a little while. Or a long while. I like it when you think about Mysteries of the Arcana. It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside!</p><p>Just a reminder, but a publisher I work for is running <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1456806822/letters-from-the-flaming-crab-2016-for-the-pathfin\" target=\"_blank\">a Kickstarter to fund a run of 12 books</a>. If the project gets funded, I'm in charge of the line. So, please consider donating to it! Not only do I get paid if you do but I get paid to create books about strange topics like rains of frogs and household magical items that aren't particularly useful to adventurers! Seriously, please consider backing it. I'd really appreciate it.</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>",
