<p>Wow. Page 91 of chapter 6. Its impressive.</p><p>Mind you, I spent part of my weekend re-reading through the archives of <a href="http://www.egscomics.com/" target="_blank">El Goonish Shive</a> so maybe it isn't as impressive as it could be but I'm still pretty proud. Also, damn you Dan Shive for being so awesome. </p><p>Ahem.</p><p>Do you like ponies? My Little Ponies? Do you play RPGs? Did you know there's a MLP-like world setting for Pathfinder called <a href="http://ponyfinder.net/" target="_blank">Ponyfinder</a>? Did you know that I've written an adventure for that setting that's all about finding a pony pirate queen's hidden treasure?</p><p>You didn't!</p><p>Well I did! <a href="http://ponyfinder.net/" target="_blank">You can buy it here</a>!</p><p>Yay! Pony pirates! Arrrggggh pony!</p><p>See you Thursday.</p>

<br> I know that problem with rereading the EGS archive. I've done it at least twice by now. <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br><br>Gotta say that I came onto the webcomic world by way of Megatokyo, then Applegeeks, Machall, Exploitation Now and soon after a whole number, EGS included.<br>

<br> When Theresa says they can't fight it, is that an official devil-power pronouncement?<br>
