I had meant to post it this morning but the wifi at the campground I'm staying in seemed to take exception to me uploading the comic. </p><p>For those of you reading this in the States (or for US citizens abroad) happy 4th of July! I hope your holiday was fun and safe.</p><p>Tomorrow I'll be back home and I'm going to be making it a priority to start doing more updates and special stuff with my Patreon this summer.</p><p>Enjoy your evening!</p><p>See you Thursday.</p>",
