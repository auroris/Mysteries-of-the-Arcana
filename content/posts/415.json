Melody's ended the story much in the same way she began it, using two classic phrases.</p><p>And hey! There's the gang! Chrys, Theresa, Kludge, Circe, WIlliam and even invisible trenchcoat guy! Though perhaps Chrys and Theresa are paying more attention to each other than the story...</p><p>Do you know, this is the first time our main characters have appeared in a comic page of MotA in over a year? Woah.</p><p>For those of you who might be interested, I was interviewed about webcomics, Mysteries of the Arcana, and character diversity over at <a href=\"http://womenwriteaboutcomics.com/2014/02/14/mysteries-of-the-arcana-an-interview-with-j-gray/\" target=\"_blank\">Women Write About Comics</a>, a news site that focuses on women in comics, both characters and creators. Go give it a read! Comment on the article and start a discussion, either there or here!</p><p>See you next Thursday.</p>",
