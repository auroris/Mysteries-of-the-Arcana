<p>As was pointed out, Mandrake comes from a cyberpunk culture. The fae there have learned to adapt their illusions to thermal imaging systems. </p><p>Someone's still gonna die, though...</p><p>For those of you interested in Silver City, the superhero webcomic by myself and Keith, the <a href="http://www.patreon.com/creation?hid=857919&amp;rf=244206" target="_blank">second page</a> has gone live for the public! Patrons got to see the page a few days early but now everyone can read it. It looks fantastic, if I do say so myself.</p><p>As a side note, yesterday was my birthday! Yay me!</p><p>See you Monday!</p>
