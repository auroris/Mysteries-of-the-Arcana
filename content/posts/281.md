We return to Chrys and Mandrake having wacky space adventures. I'm pretty excited to see what Sarrah does with my script for the next few pages. Chrys and Mandrake get to have some daring action instead of William and Mandrake.<br><br>In case you haven't noticed, I tend to write action a little quirky. I prefer my heroes to think outside the box and for the solution to be something other than a knock down, dragged out slug fest that lasts for months. Hopefully, you enjoy it!<br>

<br> What is Mandrake saying? Fist... up... golf ball?? Please help, I'm very confused!<br>

<br> Assteroids and golfballs do look similar, could be either one.<br>

<br> *punch* + *up* + *moon* = "One of these days, Alice, pow! Right in the kisser... To the moon Alice, to the moon!"

<br> @Guest JD<br>Wow... Nice translation! LOL, hilarious! Thanks for the help! Wait, who's Alice?<br>

JD's right. Its supposed to be a moon. If you want to watch the original that it is referencing, go to YouTube and google "to the moon" and "Honeymooners".<br><br><br>

<br> Alice is Ralph Cramden's wife in the old show "The Honeymooners."  She used to heckle poor Ralph relentlessly, and he'd respond with that "to the moon" bit, but of course he'd never do anything to hurt her because he loved her dearly.
<br>
<br>Alice was played by Agnes Moorehead and Ralph was played by Jackie Gleason, who made "to the moon!" a household phrase in the late 1950's and 1960's... I think.  Going by memory here.  For exact references... Google!
