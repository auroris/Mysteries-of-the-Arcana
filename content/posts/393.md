<br> Awesome.<br>So, did you tell Keith to make a fish man, or did you just kinda do it that way?<br>

<br> I noticed he had my complexion.<br>A humanoid species likely would remain muscular, that is until they developed tech that allowed them to sit around and get fat, exercising only their thumbs.<br><br>I'll bet when he gets an idea his little light bulb glows.<br>

<br> I just sat here and read your entire comic from Comic Rocket. It is amazing! That is the reason I am still awake at 12:30 in the morning. I just had to finish it before I went to bed! I look forward to the story!
