<p>Hidden Name: C. A. Morgan</p><hr><p><a href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/comics/120/" target="_blank">We've seen this gum before.</a></p><p><a href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/comics/121/" target="_blank">The gum's activation sequence.</a></p><p>Five chapters and over three hundred pages in, there's enough Mysteries of the Arcana canon established that I can begin bringing things back. The gum's a good example. It exists primarily to assist in jumping. Hop hop and then push off and you go flying in the opposite direction of where your foot pressed downward. Chrys has found a brand new application.</p><p>I am very fond of Keith's work on this page. Chrys threw one hell of a punch there in that last panel. She's back in the game - the baleful gaze will have to wait for later.</p><p>See you Monday!</p>

<br> I hate to be a killjoy, but Newton's third law?&nbsp; Sorry, but that last panel just makes me go, "Huh?"<br>

<br> Whoa, strong stuff. Makes me wonder what other applications the gum might have.<br>You could attach it to a throwable object to make a directional grenade, or stick it on a wheel of a car to flip it once it starts moving. Or put it at the end of a baseball bat for a supercharged strike.The possibilities are endless...<br>
