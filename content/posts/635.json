So, since I have recently learned of a new game being released June 21st, (which I am going to buy) I thought I'd mention it here.<br>No Man's Sky. <br>It's a game of exploration, trading, diplomacy, negotiation, battle, and more than anything else, discovery.&nbsp; The game is a procedurally generated universe, with 18 quintillion planets and star systems that can be individually explored. By explored I mean you land on the planets, which are as large as actual planets, and you move around discovering new lifeforms, catelogging and naming them, defending yourself from them, shooting them if that's what you like. You discover alien races, making allies or enemies. You find trading posts, learn new technology, buy or build upgrades to your suit and your ship... It's really just amazing.<br>So check it out. It's a landmark in future gaming tech, and just might be something great.<br><a name=\"\" target=\"\" classname=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"http://www.no-mans-sky.com/\">No Man's Sky</a><br><iframe width=\"400\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1NtHidGyJOo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe><br><font size=\"2\">PS: I don't get anything for this. I just really like the aspect of this game.</font>"
