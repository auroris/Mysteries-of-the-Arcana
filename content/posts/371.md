What is Theresa saying 'whoa' about? You'll find out next page. It'll be a pretty, pretty page, I promise you. One of those big splash pages comic books are so fond of.<br><br>I admit, the last few pages have been a little fluffy. In a normal comic book, this wouldn't have been a big deal. In a comic that only updates twice a week, it adds a lot of wait to the pacing. Thank you for sticking through it. <br><br>The page about the security measures the Inn has is foreshadowing. It will become important in the next chapter. The page about translation was something I've been meaning to explain since day one. This page? I thought you guys deserved a little tenderness between our favorite elf and gun nut. This is the last major Chrys and Theresa moment you'll get this chapter. Starting next week, we'll be getting into the Telling.<br><br>Don't forget the contest! Submit any MotA-inspired creative work, be it recipe or drawing, cosplay photo or music video, poem or custom made LEGO minifigures, to mysteriesofthearcana@gmail.com by the 15th or so. The three entries that Genn and I judge to best contain the MotA spirit will win their creators a prototype Mysteries of the Arcana tarot card! Please enter and validate our existence! :)<br>
