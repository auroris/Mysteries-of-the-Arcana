Gennifer was nice enough to send along a color sketch of Theresa. She showed what a good sport she was when I insisted she replace the gun. For the record, Theresa uses a Colt 45 m1911a1. That's the gun her daddy gave her and she's used it to blow up robots and ineffectually shoot goo and horrors thus far.<br>

<br> Love, love LOVE the new edgy look. &nbsp;The last artist had softened things a bit too much and took all the "utch" out of being butch. &nbsp;I realize its hard to do that amount of art well, but if you can't do it well and on time there's no point.

<br> I thought Jess was doing a great job, but this new girl is really growing on me too. <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">
