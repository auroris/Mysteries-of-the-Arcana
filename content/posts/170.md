Welcome to the new site! As you can see, we've done a complete overhaul. What do you think? Among the big changes? The comic's bigger! Hopefully,&nbsp; it'll be easier to make out the fine details of Keith's art work now. We've gone back and resized most of the pages and are working on fixing the rest as we speak. <br><br>Also, the cast page has been updated. The links page, too. In fact, most of the pages have been changed in one way or another. Take some time to wander around the site and enjoy!<br><br>And, of course, this is the beginning of Chapter 2: All the Way Down. That's a pretty suspicious looking turtle. Am I right?<br><br>As the Man once said. Excelsior!<br><br>P.S. I want to thank Roxie, who did most of the coding for the redesign. Also JD, who always provides excellent tech support. Lastly, I want to thank everyone who gave me advice and input on the site's new design. I know I bugged the heck out of you guys and you never told me to buzz off. Thank you!<br>

<br> *Blink!* *Blink!*

<br>Now, that's a surprise. A nice one, though. The enlarged pages are definitely welcome. And I can't wait to see what happens next. Keep up the good work!
