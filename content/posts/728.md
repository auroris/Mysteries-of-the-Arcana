<p>So, still a bit of recovery lag on my end, but hey! This page has color!</p><p>I'll be finishing both of these pages up during our brief hiatus before we start the final chapter of Mysteries of the Arcana.</p><p>Speaking of which, this of course, brings us to the end of our run of short stories, and this also gives us a lot of insight into how much Theresa and Chrys have evolved as characters. And, of course, this all fades to black, because that's how we roll around here.</p><p>All that said, we've had a lot of ups and downs with MotA, and we hope you all plan to stick with us the rest of the way!</p><p>We'll see you officially on August 7th, but unofficially, I'll be producing some unique fillers for the short interim.</p><p>Regards!</p><p>Keith W.</p>

<br> It's a shame you're planning on wrapping MotA up; I've only just come across your work and it's very good. As a (part-time, ardent and productive but yet to be successful) fantasy novelist it would seem to me that you have the potential for endless stories in the world you've built. You've built some compelling characters and have told some interesting, fun, and heartfelt tales in a medium that sorely needs them. Don't stop writing.
