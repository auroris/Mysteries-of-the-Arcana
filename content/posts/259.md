After a week and a half of no new pages, I was so excited to post the next page that I've put it up four hours early. I hope no one minds.<br><br>Everyone, please meet Sarrah. Today's wonderful page was her work and I think she's done a fantastic job. Sarrah is the co-creator of the <a name="" target="_blank" classname="" class="" href="http://www.eldlor.com/">Planes of Eldor</a>, a wonderful fantasy webcomic and fellow SpiderForest member. Everyone please welcome her!<br><br>I have to apologize to her, actually. I haven't been able to get Photoshop up and running again, so the changes I had hoped to make (to note that she's the current artist of the comic in the banner up top, for example) haven't been made yet. I hope she can forgive me!<br><br>New page on Thursday!<br>

<br>Not to worry J; the link in the blog is fine in the meantime.Hi all!&nbsp; I hope you enjoy my drawing style while Keith is away.&nbsp; I promise I'll treat the cast well.&nbsp; I can't speak for the author, however...

<br> Yay! I love Planes of Eldlor. And frankly, this page fits remarkably well with the rest of the comic. Thumbs up!
