And with this page, we come to the end of Theresa and William's part of the story. We won't see William again for a little while. Theresa will show up in the epilogue.<br><br>Next page, we'll be looking back to Chrys. Remember, she just found her dad in the brig of a pirate ship! In this last segment of Chrys and Mandrake's story some metaplot will be introduced. Also, Chrys will learn a very important lesson.<br><br>Because, the more you know is half the battle...<br>

<br>Hi J Gray and other ppl!long time no see! i have been roaming the pages of many a manga(my latest addiction)&nbsp; since i was last here on this site to check up how the story has progressed, and was quite suprised that it suddenly had other art. After browsing the site and the archives i saw u switched artists multible times during the last 2 chapters...Could u plz explain to me&nbsp;and others why?&nbsp; couse while its not that bad to do, if done to much it takes&nbsp; away the appeal of the series in my opinion(its how i find&nbsp; that i feel now :( )put it in the About section or so so ppl who have the same question can read it there <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">For the rest, keep up the good work!Greetings from the Netherlands <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">

<br> Did they get the Vit-X they came for?&nbsp; Was it in that box-car with the skeleton and did they load it onto the tracked pickup?&nbsp; Or did Theresa stash it in the digital matter storage when she started the engine?&nbsp; It was the mc'guffin of this chapter but we've never really seen it yet...<br>

<br> That's sort of the definition of a McGuffin; overwhelmingly important to the characters, of no real concern to the audience beyond the fact that it makes the story go.

<br> I love Theresa's expression in the last panel. Wonder what her mind is cooking up. Mwahaha!

<br> Do you still update on Tuesday &amp; Thursday? The Banner that said when you updated is no longer there.&nbsp;

<br> To be honest, while i have enjoyed the T&amp;W story line, Theresa is really not all that interesting a character except when Chrys is around to bounce off and to bounce off her.
