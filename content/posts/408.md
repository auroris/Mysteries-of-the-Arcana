<p>I'm hearing Mortal Kombat in my head as I look at this page. Whoever called the Wanderer beating the Transformer wins the bet! Now, what happens next? I'll tell you this much. Thursday's page is going to be gorgeous and filled with more tarot symbolism than we've ever had in a single page in this comic!</p><p>In the meanwhile, our <a href="http://kickstarter.com/projects/355389852/mysteries-of-the-arcana-chapter-5" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a> is still running! With just ten days left we've raised $3,608 out of $4,100. Which means we have less than $500 to go and we're fully funded. If you can, please help us out. We don't get the money unless the funding goal is met.</p><p>Thanks so much and see you on Thursday for the next page of the Telling!</p>

<br> Think the Wanderer isn't feeling bad about it this time.<br>
