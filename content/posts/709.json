Sidenote: I realized that we actually haven't done an Easter filler since the creation of Mysteries of the Arcana, and this idea occurred to me, and made me think it might be funny if the concept of Easter Bunnies gets kind of misinterpreted by Chrys. In my head Theresa is saying \"This is totally not what I meant when I was explaining the Easter Bunny to you.\"</p><p>Hope you guys enjoy, and hopefully we'll be back on track with Birthday on Thursday.</p><p>Keith</p>",
