I'm happy to announce that Mysteries of the Arcana will be participating in <a href=\"http://www.wagonwebcomicbattle.com/cardgame/\" class=\"\" classname=\"\" target=\"_blank\" name=\"\">WAGON's Webcomic Battle CCG</a>. There will be six MotA themed cards in their next theme deck. As part of that, I need to provide quotes for each card. I'm having trouble deciding, so I'm asking you, the readers, to help me out. Which quotes from the comic would you put on a card for each of these:</div><div><br></div><div>Chrys</div><div>Theresa</div><div>William</div><div>Mandrake</div><div>William's Sword</div><div>the Royal Road</div><div><br></div><div>I appreciate your input. You are all awesome. Thank you for your patience.</div>",
