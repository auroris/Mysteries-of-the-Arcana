Since they're now reaching the actual entrance of the pod bay, we're about to be sliding out of the heavy action ourselves. What do you guys think of how this has all played out so far?</p><p>Let us know in the comments and we'll see you on Monday!</p><p>Keith</p>",

I do have to say, I'm a little jealous of the awesome sword Aleena has... but Kietra does have some pretty cool guns.<br><br>Thank you J and Keith for bringing them back for this short story, it's been fun!!"
