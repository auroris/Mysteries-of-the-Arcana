<br> A moment we've been waiting for? <br>Hmm, I'm guessing it's either Aleena's cameo or "more lesbian elf kisses". <img alt=" Smile " src=" /smilies/smile.gif " border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2"><br><br>Looking forward to finding out on, well, probably monday. <br>Traveling. Intermittent internet. <img alt=" Cry " src=" /smilies/sad5.gif " border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2"><br>
