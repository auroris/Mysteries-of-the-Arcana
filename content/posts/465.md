<p>Hidden Name: Kevin Turner</p><hr><p><a href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/comics/146/" target="_blank">The Knight of Swords.</a></p><p>Sorry this page was late. Entirely my fault and not Keith's. He actually got it to me early but then I started watching a movie and just fell asleep and, well, there you go.</p><p>Any similarities between the Knight of Swords and the world in which a Nintendo DS/3DS game series takes place is entirely coincidental.</p><p>Really.</p><p>Ahem. On the other hand, if you happen to own a 3DS (or 2DS) I highly recommend said series of puzzle solving, top hat wearing adventures!</p><p>You know, the entire reason I created Baron Sir was for this page. I adore what Keith did with him here.</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>

<br> I really love how he loses his anger and focus at the mere mention of the word "puzzle". He even losses his monocle!<br>
