  "text": "Hello!<br><br>I'm pleased to say that I have offered the position of artist of Mysteries of the Arcana to Gennifer Bone. She has been quite gracious and accepted the offer. As we speak, she is hard at work on the next few pages.<br><br>I had quite a few people show interest in the position. In all, seven artists (eight, technically, as one of the artists was actually a team of two artists) sent me audition pages. I was quite pleased at the range and talent of the people interested. <br><br>In the end, I picked Gennifer because I felt she best understood the comic and the characters, both as a reader and as an artist. I've posted a full color sketch she did of Mandrake to go along with this page. As the week goes by, I'll show off more of her art, including her audition page.<br><br>If you are interested in seeing more art from Gennifer, you can see her DeviantArt account here: <a name=\"\" target=\"_blank\" classname=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"http://razielart.deviantart.com/\">http://razielart.deviantart.com/</a><br><br>Everyone, please welcome Gennifer to the Mysteries of the Arcana team!",
