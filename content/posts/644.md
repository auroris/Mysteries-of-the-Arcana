<p>And here we are, wondering and making connections and trying to figure things out! If this were a TV show I'd have one of those cameras that circle around the table to get everyone nice and dizzy. But, since we're a comic, none of that fancy high tech stuff for us!</p><p><a href="http://www.poll-maker.com/poll699570x76EC4Af0-28" target="_blank">I'm leaving the poll open for a few more days</a>. There you can vote on who you want to be in the next set of short comics that'll make up chapter 7. Go vote if you haven't! The fate of the free world depends on it!</p><p>So... what's everyone playing, video game wise? I've been sucked into <a href="http://www.tinyco.com/tinyco-games/marvel-avengers-academy/" target="_blank">Avengers Academy</a> myself. I've got Far Harbor and Disgaea 5 but haven't started them yet.</p>

<br> I have a couple tips for Far Harbor. BRING NICK, some leaded armor and anti-rad chems (the main weapon for the Children does more rad damage than a Gamma Gun, not to mention the fog's low level rads), and be prepared to get one-shotted a fair bit. I had a lvl 40 get one-shoted multiple times by some of the critters.Those bloody Gulpers can be tougher than a Deathclaw.<br>
