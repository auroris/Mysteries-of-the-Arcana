<p>And thus we come to the end of the Telling! We pull back from the story and remember this is, in fact, a storyteller. Melody is sharing this tale with us. This isn't the end of the chapter, though! We've got more pages coming up so stick with us!</p><p>The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/355389852/mysteries-of-the-arcana-chapter-5" target="_blank">MotA ch 5 Kickstarter</a> is doing amazingly! We're at $4,705 (out of $4,100) with 72 hours left to the end! Our next stretch goal, a brand new audio production set in the Mysteries of the Arcana universe, is at $5,700 but every dollar we raise will help keep the comic moving forward. If you're interested in contributing and you haven't yet, now is a great time!</p><p>We reached our first two stretch goals and will be producing two new, short comics. The first takes place shortly after chapter 1 and will be a bonus story in the digital trade of chapter 1. It will be illustrated Tiffany Munroe of <a href="http://www.stargazersgate.com/" target="_blank">Stargazer's Gate</a>.</p><p>The second story takes place BEFORE chapter 1 and tells the tale of how Mandrake came to live at the Inn. It will be a bonus story in the digital trade of chapter 2. This story will be illustrated by Sarrah Wilkinson of <a href="http://www.rednebulastudios.com/" target="_blank">Red Nebula Studios</a>. You might remember she illustrated about thirty pages of the comic during chapter 3. </p><p>Alright! See you Thursday for the next page and the end of the Kickstarter!</p>

Adamas, if you can russle up the extra $5 you might want to increase your pledge to $15. The Mandrake story is in the second chapter digital trade which backers get at the $15 level.<br><br>
