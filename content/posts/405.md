<p>That last panel seems a bit ominous, doesn't it?</p><p>It has been a while so let me reintroduce the poor character being captured in the comic above. That is the Ace of Cups, first introduced <a href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/comics/405/" target="_blank">here</a> and last seen <a href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/comics/406/" target="_blank">here</a>. I'm sure you can guess exactly where the Ace of Cups has been trapped.</p><p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/355389852/mysteries-of-the-arcana-chapter-5/" target="_blank">The chapter 5 Kickstarter</a> is going strong. We're at $2,768 out of $4,100. That's 67% funded with 21 days left to go. </p><p>Speaking of the Kickstarter, I've got some exciting news! Two of the rewards we'll be giving out are digital trade copies of chapters 1 and 2. I'm pleased and proud to announce that Ursula Vernon, creator of the  <a href="http://diggercomic.com/" target="_blank">Hugo Award winning Digger</a> and the very popular <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dragonbreath-1-Ursula-Vernon-ebook/dp/B005KGJXAW/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1389844131&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=ursula+vernon" target="_blank">Dragonbreath series</a> will be writing the forward for the digital trade copy of Mysteries of the Arcana chapter 1: Heavens and Earths. I'm also pleased and proud to announce that Howie Noel, creator of <a href="http://www.taranormal.com/" target="_blank">Tara Normal</a> and official cartoonist for the Atlantic Paranormal Society (aka the Ghost Hunters guys) will be writing the forward for the digital trade copy of Mysteries of the Arcana chapter 2: All the Way Down. </p><p>The digital trades are available as rewards in the Kickstarter now but will also be for sale after the Kickstarter is over.   </p><p>See everyone on Monday!</p>

<br> Just to be picky: Turtles (like most reptiles) have three-chambered hearts.

<br> Wow, talk about getting to the heart of the matter! *runs away from the anti-pun barrage*<br>

<br> And so, the Ace of Cups was imprisoned at the heart of his world. <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br><br>The last panel is indeed quite ominous. Perhaps the Corrupter wants to rule all the worlds, and has found another "solution" for his brethren.<br>

<br> Sorry, but I went and ruined your ~ 2/3 funding. You're now up to 69% <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br><br><br>

Fairportfan : Ordinary turtles from the Hierophant do, of course. Who knows what giant floating space turtles have. <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br><br>

<br> Haha, thanks but though I'm pretty good at guessing plot, I have no experience writing it. Far better to leave it in your capable hands. <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br>

<br> Well, thanks to Gunsolo's insight now we know what to expect, don't we? Kinda, sorta... I'm not really sure, but if I was a corrupter I'd want to own it all... muahahahaha! <img alt=" Warning " src=" /smilies/warning1.gif " border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2"> <font size="2">*you need an evil laugh smiley*</font><br>I'm so confused.<br>Anyway, I backed what I could, J. Sorry it isn't more, I'd push you over if I could.<br>

JD, there wouldn't be a Mysteries of the Arcana without you. I can't overstate how important the contributions you have made are. Thank you for backing us all these years.<br><br>
