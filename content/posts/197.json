Teresa looks a little less tomboyish then normal! and thats fine with me!"

      "text": "\"Now, my question for you. Do you know why Chrys is sorry? Can you figure it out?\"\n<br>\n<br>Real reason though? I think she feels that she bored Theresa to tears and in telling her story and lost an opportunity to spend more time with her. She killed the mood when her origin story involving her father were getting too detailed about him, and not about her. Darn one line cover ups about yourself are always a bummer. If only she talked about herself as a baby, maybe Theresa would have found that cute."

Being a dreamer and the relationship between her parents (and the odd love triangle between her parents and Kludge) were very important in developing who she is and how she approaches relationships - like this one with Theresa.<br><br>I am glad you care about Chrys, though. If people don't care about the characters, they won't care about the story. <br><br>On a more serious note, can you give me details on your OS and browser? I'll pass them along to JD and see if we can't cure your problem."
