Today's wonderful page was her work and I think she's done a fantastic job. Sarrah is the co-creator of the <a name=\"\" target=\"_blank\" classname=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"http://www.eldlor.com/\">Planes of Eldor</a>, a wonderful fantasy webcomic and fellow SpiderForest member. Everyone please welcome her!<br><br>I have to apologize to her, actually. I haven't been able to get Photoshop up and running again, so the changes I had hoped to make (to note that she's the current artist of the comic in the banner up top, for example) haven't been made yet. I hope she can forgive me!<br><br>New page on Thursday!",
