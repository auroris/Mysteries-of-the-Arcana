<p>And here's our official chapter 6 title page!</p><p>Pathfinder has been on my mind a lot lately. In part because I've been running a Pathfinder game via roll20.net (which is an excellent service I recommend) and in part because...</p><p>I am now a professional RPG writer! I'm pleased to say I've contracted with a few different third-party publishers of Pathfinder-compatible material as a writer. My first pro book, <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/143921/More-Forgotten-Feats" target="_blank">More Forgotten Feats from Flaming Crab Games</a> just came out. It is only $1.95 and contains many feats that are just common sense stuff that should have been in the game from day one. I contributed to the book (four feats, in this case) so I highly recommend it! For the price, it can't be beat. Please give it a try.</p><p>Tell me about your PF character! I wanna hear!</p><p>See you Friday for Bricks of the Arcana!</p>
