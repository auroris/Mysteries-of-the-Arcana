Hey everyone. Just an update. We're experiencing hurricane weather as we speak. Power has gone out once and may go out again. Our basement is beginning to flood a little, which sucks because it is a finished basement and is used as an office.<br><br>So, if the comic isn't up Monday, don't panic. Its probably late because I'm not able to get online.<br>

<br> Hopefully it's no more than rain and your basement stands up to it.<br><br>I'm a dummy and forgot to wish you a happy Birthday on Saturday when we spoke. *smacks self*&nbsp; Ok, a belated Happy Birthday!&nbsp; Hope you're not too wet.<br>
