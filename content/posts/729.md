<p>When I found out we were taking a short break between this and the next chapter, I knew I really wanted to do something special to kind of "bookend" this short story, giving just a litttttle more of a hint into how things wind up as we fade to black.</p><p>All in all, I'm super happy with this, canon or not, and hope you all enjoy it as well.</p><p>Keith W.</p>
