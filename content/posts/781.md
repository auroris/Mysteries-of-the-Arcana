<p>So, when I started this out, I knew it was going to be a mini-quest, but I am curious what you guys think? Specifically, should this end on a serious note, or something more comedic and fun?</p><p>Let me know in the comments!</p>

<br> I dunno, going to be a bit brutal here..... This has been a really fun and well done epic and then it went off the rails, what, over a year ago at least.&nbsp; I know there are reasons, I've followed this epic for a good long time.&nbsp; I stop by once a day to see if anything has changed, like maybe something, anything, is happening.&nbsp; Well, it just gets slower and ssssllllloooooooowwwwweeerrrrr.&nbsp; At some point it grinds to a halt.&nbsp; Is this the point?&nbsp; I don't know, but you can see for self how many folks have enough interest left to comment,,,, 4 replies and now me, the meanie.&nbsp; Maybe it can just get some steam up by actually presenting something?&nbsp; Or maybe it's time to kill it.&nbsp; It has been a great story though, sad to see it dying.&nbsp;&nbsp;
