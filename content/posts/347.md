I haven't recommended a fellow webcomic in a while. Of course, there's the great webcomics in the SpiderForest collective. Those are shown in the banner at the top of the comic. Those are all worth a read. <br><br>The comic I want to recommend today, however, is a fellow fantasy adventure called Shadowbinders. Its about 150 pages in, far enough that it has a strong plotline established. The writing is tight and art beautiful to look at. I highly recommend it.<br><br><a name="" target="_blank" classname="" class="" href="http://shadowbinders.com/"><img alt="" src="/pics/shadowbinders.jpg" border="0" hspace="" vspace=""></a><br>

<br> Did Chrystalline bleach her hair before leaving the cell?

<br> Purple streaks replaced by blonde highlights... hmm.&nbsp; Well, maybe it's just the lack of trust.<br>

Gennifer quickly sent me a replacement with Chrys's hair properly stripped. <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br><br><br>
