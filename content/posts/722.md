<p>As I'm writing this particular short story, I'm realizing its the most important in the comic thus far. While next chapter will explain the metaplot I've been dropping since day one, Mysteries of the Arcana has always been about the romance between Chrys and Theresa.</p><p>Keith, meanwhile, is knocking these pages out of the park. They look beautiful!</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>

And believe it or not, one of the things I've had the most fun with has been the way Chrys' outfit interacts with her body, where it pulls and squishes in places, showing that she's not skin and bones, and has actual mass.<br><br>

<br> Kinda sad there was no ambush kiss. But I get to say that I was right! *Dances like no one's reading*<br>
