<p>And here's today's new page! I love the look on Chrys's face. Keith did such a good job at drawing her utter disgust with the situation in every panel.</p><p>At the suggestion of our amazing host, JD, we'll be moving Bricks of the Arcana to Sunday. JD is absolutely right. It makes sense to have our backup comic in the middle and not so close to the main comic.</p><p>I want to thank everyone for their well wishes. I really appreciate it. I'm pleased to announce I've begun work on a new short comic called "Birthdays" set in the MotA universe. Patreon supporters will get first crack at it, of course.</p><p>So, enough about me. What's up in your life?</p>
