<p>We (and by we, I mean JD), believe we have isolated the misdirected issue and deleted it! It turns out it was a metric measuring site called SiteMeter. We've deleted the offending link and, hopefully, no one will be redirected to a page about gardening. Or whatever it is this month. Let us know if you continue to have trouble.</p><p>We won't be posting a comic on Thursday due to it being Christmas Eve. There may be a Christmas filler but that depends on how much free time Keith has. He's got a lot on his plate to finish up before the end of the year. Please do check back.</p><p>Merry Christmas, either way!</p>

<br>Stumbled on this comic just yesterday and I am already eagerly awaiting new pages!Such an interesting world and lovely characters with a slowly brewing girl on girl romance, all the things I love.&nbsp;Hope you both have a great xmas and new year.
