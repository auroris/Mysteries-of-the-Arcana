I've got to give Sarrah credit. In addition to doing a great job as artist, she's been very patient with me. This page (and the next one) were particularly hard for me to write. I wanted to get what was said just right, as I felt it represented an important moment in the development of both Theresa and William. I changed the text multiple times and each time she just said 'no problem' and went along with it.<br><br>So, thank you Sarrah. I'm lucky to be working with you!<br>

<br> Ok... what?<br><br>My sister once came to visit with her current boyfriend in tow, a nice fellow from England.&nbsp; He had quite the cockney accent with flavorful phrases, and at one point I stopped him mid-sentence and demanded, "Speak English man!"<br><br>He got quite a kick out of that.<br>

<br> Did he respond with something like "certainly, governor?"<br>
