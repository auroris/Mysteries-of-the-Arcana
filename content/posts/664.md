<p>And now we come to Jailbreak, a story never before read by anyone! Except the Patreon supporters who got to read this page in advance. However, this story hasn't appeared as a bonus before so it is all new. Plus, it stars two guest stars modeled after very important backers of Mysteries of the Arcana!</p><p>Also, look! Captain Featherbeard is back! Everyone loves him! </p><p>See you Thursday!</p>

<br> Yay, new story!<br>When is this one set, before or after we saw these two last time?<br>

<br> I don't remember these two - but at first glance i thought they might be Theresa and Chrys's evil twins.
