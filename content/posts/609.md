<p>Due to the serial nature of webcomics, it has been a few months since we last saw the word of power. For those who don't remember, Theresa <a href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/comics/598/" target="_blank">received it </a>after making up a <a href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/comics/597/" target="_blank">haiku</a> in the <a href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/comics/595/" target="_blank">Garden of Epic Manly Poetry</a>.</p><p>There's been some speculation about what happened to the acorns the viquirrels need to help them sleep through the winter, including an idea that they sold the nuts to get some guns. They did not. The two tribes went to war because there weren't enough acorns as winter approached. If you looked closely back when Chrys and Theresa <a href="http://mysteriesofthearcana.com/comics/615/" target="_blank">hiked across the battlefield</a> you can see hints of the remains of the trees. </p><p>Finally, I am not someone who likes doing the whole promoting thing. I'm a horrible salesperson. But the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1456806822/letters-from-the-flaming-crab-2016-for-the-pathfin" target="_blank">Letters from the Flaming Crab Kickstarter</a> could really use some help. We've stalled at about halfway to our goal. Letters from the Flaming Crab is a Pathfinder-compatible RPG line that aims to put out one book a month, each time on a different and somewhat unusual topic. If the Kickstarter gets funded we can afford to pay writers. Also, if the Kickstater funds, Flaming Crab can afford to pay the guy in charge of the line's development. That'd be me. It would be nice to get paid for my work there so, please, consider giving us a dollar or two.</p><p>Thank you! See you Monday!</p>

<br> Uh oh, so ominous! <br>So, what will the 'grow' rock do, make the trees grow back?&nbsp; *rumble rumble* a shower of acorns!<br>

<br> Judging by the look on Crys' face, I'd say yes, that will happen. The two button heads aren't going to be happy. But the big question is why? Why are the trees gone and what do the button heads get from viquirrels fighting?
