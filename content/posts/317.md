I admit, I wrote this page specifically to showcase Gennifer's talents for detail. She's done an amazing job on this page of breathing life into a post-apocolyptic landscape. This page really demonstrates how well she does with landscapes, with little things like the ragged edges of torn metal, and the decay of rust.<br><br>We've got some fun action coming up in the next few pages and before this story is done, Theresa will end up with a new toy!<br>

<br> Action and new toys?! This is why we come here (and possibly lesbian love, the hottest kind of all. Not really the point of the story, but it's there.)<br>

<br> I can see why you didn't choose my work. You wanted a better sense of epicness in the use of details, and I just haven't spent enough time on Photoshop to figure out any of it.<br>

<br> Very nice page. I have to wonder, is the title for the page either a blatant hint for what comes next or just because you like that song (if not both)?<br>

<br> Speaking of details, is William supposed to switch his sword from the left to the right hand between panels 1 and 2 and back again before panel 3?
