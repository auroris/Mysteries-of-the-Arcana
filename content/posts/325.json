  "text": "Sorry about this page being late, folks!<br><br>One of the tricks to being a comic writer (and a writer in general) is when to explain and when to let the audience fill in the blanks. For example, some of you might realize that Theresa is using a decorative, digital storage device on this page. We haven't really seen one since chapter 1. Notice the distinctiveness of the shape. Very different from Chrystalline's. <br><br>By the way? We have pages of Theresa being clever and William being badass coming up. Physics will be defied.",
