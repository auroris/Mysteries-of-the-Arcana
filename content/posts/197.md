I don't know about you, but I think that Theresa as Keith drew her in panel 2 is about the most feminine she's ever been. Except maybe in the first page, where we see her in a dress at her dad's funeral.<br><br>Now, my question for you. Do you know why Chrys is sorry? Can you figure it out?<br>

A foreshadowing of some action Chrys will be forced to take that she knows will hurt her friend's feeling or trust?&nbsp; If it was an&nbsp;apology for being insensitive earlier to Theresa's still open wounds concerning Debbie, I doubt Chrys would have whispered it after Theresa walked away.<br><br>

<br> Sorry for what?&nbsp; WHAT?<br><br>What's she going to do?&nbsp; Maybe she's having to sit idly by while her friend is forced to undergo some kind of worth test, something administered by a giant turtle with an island on it's back.<br><br>or...<br>

<br>As seen before with the green puke with people's faces in it, this turtle island seems to force people to face their fears and/or past.Just think about Luke Skywalker walking in the Cave of fear. i think thats about the same.&nbsp;and i agree! Teresa looks a little less tomboyish then normal! and thats fine with me!

<br> "Now, my question for you. Do you know why Chrys is sorry? Can you figure it out?"
<br>
<br>Real reason though? I think she feels that she bored Theresa to tears and in telling her story and lost an opportunity to spend more time with her. She killed the mood when her origin story involving her father were getting too detailed about him, and not about her. Darn one line cover ups about yourself are always a bummer. If only she talked about herself as a baby, maybe Theresa would have found that cute.

All very interesting ideas! Continue to speculate, please. Except poor Jeyl. Jeyl, you won't be satisfied until I put up a comic called "the Adventures of Baby Chrys" are you? <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br><br><br>

<br> Like what Ysa said. Some sweet foreshadowing. My speculations are usually really off. I think Thera will have to have fight against a horde of those magic cloaks!<br>

You did learn quite a bit about Chrystalline's background, though! Being a dreamer and the relationship between her parents (and the odd love triangle between her parents and Kludge) were very important in developing who she is and how she approaches relationships - like this one with Theresa.<br><br>I am glad you care about Chrys, though. If people don't care about the characters, they won't care about the story. <br><br>On a more serious note, can you give me details on your OS and browser? I'll pass them along to JD and see if we can't cure your problem.<br><br><br>

"Adventures of Baby Chry"?!&nbsp; Now that would be interesting.&nbsp; I'd like to see what kind of chaos Chrys created for the adults around her.<br><br>
