<br> There is a perfectly reasonable explanation for all of this. First off, Mandrake is so busy running the inn that she forgot to pay the power bill. Then, in the sudden darkness, William stumbled over the garbage bin, causing the noise, and Theresa stubbed her toe on the Beast while walking over to him. <br>Quite simple really. <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br>
