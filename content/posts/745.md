<p> So, what if Theresa and Chrys met a lot sooner in life? What things would they have done, what games would they play?</p><p>In that same spirit, I also wanted to consider the season. So a fun little snowscape with young Theresa and Chrys playing, or perhaps scheming a bit.</p><p>My other half is going in for surgery on her arm today (nothing major, but definitely needed/overdue to help her get her hands back for her own art). So, thoughts, energies and positive vibes are all welcome!</p><p>And the same to J, his work schedule has been pretty hectic, and I know it's killing him that all his work writing is eating into his ability to tell his own story here, so, we're crossing our fingers we'll be able to get back to the story proper very soon.</p><p>Keith W.</p>

<br> Many positive thoughts for your other half Keith, and let J know that we'll still be here when he get through his other work, so he doesn't need to stress.
