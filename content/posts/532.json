No RPG books I've written to tell you anyway. :)</p><p>More seriously, I want to take this week to thank everyone who reads Mysteries of the Arcana. If you comment or don't, if you read each update or come back once in a while and catch up. Thank you. Without you, half the story would be gone. A story needs an audience.</p><p>Bricks of the Arcana on Friday. New story comic next Wednesday. See you then!</p>",
