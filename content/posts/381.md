And here we see the four Aces combining their powers to create the very first arcana. In fact, the arcana they are creating is one we have seen before. Can you guess which one it is? I bet you can!<br>

<br> But, seriously: Turtle Island, am I correct?<br><br>Oh what'dya know, a turtle is the button I need to find to submit this message.<br>

<br> Does that mean the Turtle is the Fool?<br>Also, see my note on twitter.<br>

<br> J/k, but from a tarot standpoint wouldn't the Road/Fool come first instead of the Turtle/Magician?<br>

<br> A road needs a place to start from, my dear Ayshara.<img alt=" Wink " src="%20//smilies/wink1.gif%20" border="0" hspace="2" vspace="2"><br>

<br> I suppose this is supposed to be why we so often use aces as the highest cards?<br>

Just thought I'd post something here to say I hope things are alright. The site hasn't updated in over a month, now. I haven't even seen any posts about something being wrong or things being delayed. Which is not to say that the only value this site or its creators have is in providing content for me to mooch off of. But historically no news is a clear indicator of lots of bad news, and I thought perhaps it would be worth at least offering a supportive hug, and my thanks for a really wonderful story. Even if it never continues, I'm glad to have gotten as much as we have.

<br> I was also wondering about the contest results from last month.<br>

<br> I wish I knew what was going on, myself- and I'm the artist!<br>
