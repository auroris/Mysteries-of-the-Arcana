<p>I realized, in the midst of this hiatus/fillerfest, I have somewhat neglected seeing William as a fun source to work with, and as such, I decided I wanted to revisit the wedding gown idea for a moment.</p><p>Here we see William in a tux, and le gasp, smiling! </p><p>The question is, which side has the groomsmen? Chrys' or Theresa's? Anyway. Thank you guys for sticking with us, and we'll see you soon!</p>

<br> Well, since an old wallpaper shows Theresa in the gown and Chrys in the tux...<br>
