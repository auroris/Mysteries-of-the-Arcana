Hey folks! Keith's been working for over two years straight, reliably pumping out two pages a week every week. What does that mean?<br><br>It means he is a little burned out. I don't blame him. Remember, he's doing this on top of having a job and a regular life. This isn't what he does for a living. He does this after he does what he does for a living.<br><br>So, the long and a short? He needs a break to get back in touch with his inner artist. That doesn't mean MotA takes a break, however. Someone will have to pitch hit for Keith until he's ready to get back in the game.<br><br>This is a paying gig. Full rights and ownership remain with me while any original art produced remains the property of the owner. I need two full color pages per week, each containing between 2 and 6 panels (usually). There's no need to match Keith's style or duplicate his work. <br><br>Interested or know someone who is interested? Contact me at mysteriesofthearcana (at) gmail (dot) com or through the contact link here on the site.<br><br>The sooner I find someone who can work well as part of our team, the sooner we can get back on schedule. <br>
