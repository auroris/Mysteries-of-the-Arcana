Seriously, would there be a better way to die than to fall off a cliff on the back of a giant turtle?<br><br>Chrys would probably argue yes, at this point.<br>

<br> I wonder if Theresa realizes she's about to repeat that history, with Chrys being that close to the edge...  or will the Turtle remind her?

<br>Either that, or&nbsp;hopefully she still has her feather, or she'll be able to grab a cloak flying by&nbsp;to save herself (And tame it at the same time, two for one deal!) or... Well, anything that makes her not kill another friend again.By the way, I just came across this comic today and just read through the entire archive... And I have to say that this comic is absolutely wonderful! It certainly gets a spot in my personal "Top 5 webcomic". The art is beautiful, the story is nice and the characters are attaching... It's a story that deals with mature and sad subjects, yet&nbsp;there's comedy moments and it's&nbsp;very colorful:&nbsp;It's not all in a dark and depressing style like so many of the "mature" comics you see everywhere.&nbsp;Thank you for making a wonderful comic that's such a joy to read! <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0">

Jeyl: A very good distinction. Will Theresa realize?<br><br>Ketira: No one's going over the edge. Except maybe a flying cloak.<br><br>Ayra: Welcome to Mysteries of the Arcana! Your note came at just the right time. I was in a bit of a depression over the comic and my writing. You helped lift me back up. Thank you!<br><br><br>
