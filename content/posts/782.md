<p>So, sorry for the little delay here. Depression attacked, and I managed to work my way around it. I wanted to do more with this page, but honestly, adding extra panels just seemed to diminish the idea I wanted to put forward with this image, showing that there's definitely much more than meets the eye to our pawnbroker.</p>
