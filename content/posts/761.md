<p>So! This brings this little short story to a close. I hope you guys have enjoyed this little non-adventure adventure. Things are still wildly crazy and nutty in the world of MotA, and it's entirely possible, I might do another short story or so. </p><p>If you guys had a choice, what kind of stories would you like to see during this time?</p>

<br> No one's gonna comment on the fact that Chrys did a quest for a Gelfling? <img src="//smilies/razz.gif" alt="Razz" border="0">
