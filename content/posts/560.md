<br> ahh summer, low-90s with a humidity anywhere from 30-100%. And people wonder why I prefer Fall<br>

I'd love some snow, mostly because the unattainable is more desirable. <br>So far this summer it's been well over 120f, but it's cooling down now.<br><br><img alt="A bit warm still" src="http://test.wingnetwork.com/pics/warm.jpg" align="right" height="294" hspace="" border="0" vspace="" width="394"><br>Last edited by JD<br>Edited 1 time(s).<br><br>

<br> I'd say fall is probably my favorite season, but unfortunately it only lasts for about a week at most around here.

<br> I like all the seasons, but my favourite is spring.<br><br>And we've had the hottest July and August for a long time. And finally this weekend a few cooler days and, more importantly, nights.<br>
