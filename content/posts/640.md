Check!</p><p>Bubble gum that lets you jump? Check!</p><p>Nintendo power glove that amplifies your strength in one arm? Check!</p><p>What's your favorite magic/science fantasy tech item that we've created in Mysteries of the Arcana? Tell us in the comments below!</p><p>See you Thursday!</p>

<br> I'd say the decorative digital matter storage units. Those things are CRAZY useful. <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br>
