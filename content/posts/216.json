You've seen it in pictures and heard it in words.<br><br>I apologize for my absence lately. I haven't responded to comments like I would prefer. We just closed on a house so we've been busy doing those ten thousand things that must be done before moving. This will likely continue for a while longer. Please, be patient.",

Probably not the best thing for an asthmatic rape victim with a incredible imagination to read about, neh? Nevertheless, I enjoyed it, and am overjoyed to see that you aren't afraid to confront these taboo-upon-taboo subjects (asthma attacks/group rape/kavorkian style murder/probably something else I'm not thinking of). Nice writing, J, and I hope to see better testaments to Keith's talents in future pages."
