She was nice enough to do a filler for us a few days back and we weren't able to link to her comic for a plug due to technical errors. So, let's fix that.</p><p>Go read the gorgeous, Celtic mythology rich <a href=\"http://samhainnight.com/the-comic/\" target=\"_blank\">Samhain Night</a> right after you read this blog!</p><p>Now, to remind everyone. Blue is a sentient color. He's literally an intelligent version of the color blue. Physically, this translates into a blue goo which can heal people. Blue usually stays inside the space suit because it finds that interacting with a world meant for people who aren't sentient shades of colors gets easier when one has hands and thumbs and a voice box/speaker. However, Baron Sir seems to have made the mistake of assuming that if Blue's outside of his suit, he's harmless.</p><p>Whoops!</p><p>See you Monday!</p>",
