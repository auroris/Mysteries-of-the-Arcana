I feel the need to explain here. Theresa's room is in the basement of the Inn, directly below the tap room. Her room opens into a little used storeroom and, from there, she takes a service lift up to the tap room itself. As soon as I find it, I'm going to post the layout I did of the tap room way back when I started the comic. I created it in Sims 2, actually. For those of you who are thinking of getting into comics (or writing in general)? Be aware that the Sims is a fantastic tool for helping you decide room layout.<br><br>Meanwhile, the vote is still ongoing! We're going to be changing the color of Theresa's dress and YOU get to decide what the color's gonna be. Just add a comment to this journal entry noting what your choice will be before the next comic is posted! Only one vote per reader, please!<br>

<br> Wow!&nbsp; She looks positively victorian. Delicious too.&nbsp; I think I might eat her up myself.<br><br>Theresa should totally be in black. She's the kind of girl to shy from bright colors and wear no colors at all.<br>

<br> Dark purple dress for Theresa sounds good to me.

<br> I'm not sure what I was expecting, but that wasn't it. That said I like it, <br><br>And I have two votes. <br><br>Considering my knowledge of fashion is I should try not to wear the same t-shirt three days in row I'll give my vote to someone less clothing impaied. <br>

<br> Chrys's dress is perfect, clearly she has the better taste. I personally use the Sims for character designs.<br>

<br> Been loving this comic in secret for a while now, and I've finally worked up the courage to speak out. "It's an awesome comic, and I applaud it wholeheartdly, I shall be keeping my eye on it for some time to come."<br><br>For the dress vote: Dark purple would be nice. (black is the closest color to Light, <img src="//smilies/laugh.gif" alt="LOL" border="0">)<br><br>I has a few questions that I've been meaning to ask(I know, I should of said something sooner). You use the Tarot very creatively throughout your story, and I find it amazing. However, in reviewing my knowledge....I realized that I've never heard or seen&nbsp; "The Dreamer" card. Is this card original to your story, and cannon? And, going along these lines of thought....Are there going to be more original Tarot?<br>Also, for curiosity's sake...Who's the key for the Fool?<br>

Ceridwen. Thank you for the compliments. There is no 'Dreamer' card in any tarot deck that I'm aware of. There is also no dreamer arcana and Chrys, herself, isn't a key. She can't activate the Royal Road and her powers are entirely self-taught.<br><br>There isn't a Fool key in the story. Yet, anyway.<br><br><br>
