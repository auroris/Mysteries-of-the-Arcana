       <p>When I start writing a chapter of Mysteries of the Arcana, one of the first things I ask myself is "what do I need to accomplish and deal with". I don't mean plot. I mean, what did I mess up last chapter than I need to talk about this chapter. I hate it when serial entertainment puts a character through the ringer in one episode and then forgets it even happened in the next.</p><p>So, Theresa's going to get to deal with the fact that, last chapter, she shot someone dead. That isn't something anyone should take lightly, no matter how many Mark Millar or Garth Ennis comics people read. It should be real. It should be soul wrenching and it should be intense. I hope I portray that well here.</p><p>New comic on Monday.</p>

<p class="comment_text"> </p><p class="comment_text"><br> I thought so as well. (And as an amateur competitive shooter I know the feeling of looking up your barrel and noticing for the first time the toll years of use have taken on it.)<br></p><br><p class="comment_info">Last edited by Guest<br>Edited 1 time(s).</p>

<p class="comment_text"> </p><p class="comment_text"><br> </p><p>Why is she apologising to her father?</p><p>He gave her the gun; he was a soldier, he died on deployment, apparently.</p><p>He would have known that she might someday kill someone with it; that's what handguns are for.</p><p>=======</p><p>Or does she feel as if she's not being tough enough about it, that he'd be disappointed in her for not shaking it off and going on?</p>
