Due to a medical emergency, the page is going to late. Keith and I are both fine but there are things that are distracting. Sorry, folks.<br>

<br> Hope y'all are doing okay and noones in seriously sick/hurt. <br>Page looks great =] , yea I think Thera will forgive Chrys, but it was probably better for Thera to have faced her past now than later.<br>
