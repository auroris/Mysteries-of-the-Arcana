Its all very adorable and Disney...</p><p>... except she's in the equivalent of her early 20s for her people and she's saucy as hell. Which means she's happy to swear and that mindset interprets what might otherwise be non-profanity insults directly into profanities.</p><p>Only, how do you display profanity in pictographs? It has been a fun challenge for Keith and I.</p><p>Looks like the animated objects staffing the kitchen don't much like Mandrake's fuzzy host, doesn't it?</p><p>Hope everyone had a good holiday! What presents did folks get?</p><p>See you Monday!</p>",
