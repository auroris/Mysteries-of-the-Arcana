I apologize for the delay and hope you all can forgive me. I assure you, it was entirely the fault of the writer and not the artist.<br><br>Welcome to chapter four! Is that Theresa up there? Putting on makeup? Plucking her eyebrows? Wearing jewelry? Have we entered a strange, alternate dimension? Keep reading and find out!<br><br>In the meanwhile, I did some updating to the site. A banner has been added for Tiffany Munroe's <a name="" target="_blank" classname="" class="" href="http://betweenplaces.spiderforest.com/">Between Places</a>. Tiffany did the very cool, ten page 'Questions' series that ran between chapter three and four.<br><br>Speaking of that series, I moved it to the extras section. I also moved the fillers Gennifer did over the last few months to our art galleries.<br><br>Enjoy!<br>
