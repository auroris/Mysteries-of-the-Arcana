       Several people guessed that it was the germs that proved a fatal flaw to the horrors and not the kiss or just random bodily fluids. Good guess! It is a little War of the Worlds but it makes sense to me. <br><br>There have also been questions on where the horrors come from and how they've come to be this very perky way. I promise that question will be answered but not for a few weeks. Come Monday, there'll be another switch. Time to slide away from Theresa and William for a while. I know some of you are groaning but would it be fair to deprive fans of Chrys and Mandrake their chance to see everyone's favorite, pointed earred duo for weeks or even months?<br>
