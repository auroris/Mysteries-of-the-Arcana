It's not quite the exact outfit, because i thought maybe Chrys has a little different taste in undies, but all in all, this was rather fun to do. I still have the Mandrake idea percolating, but I'm still taking suggestions and ideas for more inbetween stuff.</p><p>J's prepping for GenCon and he's working on recharging his batteries so he can get back to writing. I'm glad you guys are sticking it out with us!</p>
