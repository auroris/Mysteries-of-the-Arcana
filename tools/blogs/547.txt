She loves her gun and now she hates her gun. Hence the title of today's page. Will she bring it? Will she use it? </p><p>What do you think?</p><p>I've been on a reading streak lately. I've just finished reading the 21 books in the Phryne Fisher mystery series by Kerry Greenwood about a female private detective in 1920s Australia. I can't recommend them enough. They're an amazing study of the time as well as excellent pulp detective fiction staring a strong woman.</p><p>I'm currently working my way through Meg Cabot's Princess Diary series. Meg Cabbot is often underappreciated, I think, as a writer of young adult fiction.</p><p>After that, I'm on my way to the Longmire mysteries by Craig Johnson. Another detective set that I think has a lot of potential.</p><p>BTW, both Phryne Fisher and Longmire have shows based on them currently available via Netflix. I can't recommend them both enough. In an era filled with clone crime procedurals I'm always happy to find a good, unique PI series.</p><p>WHAT'S ON YOUR SUMMER READING LIST? SHARE WITH US IN THE COMMENTS!</p><p>See you Monday!</p>

<p class="Comment_text"> </p><p class="Comment_text"><span class="Comment_info">Guest post by "Tsuki_Ouji"</span><br> Well, hell. I just read this entire comic in one (4-or-so hour long) sitting. Now I'm all caught up.<br>And sad. I always hate it when I get all caught up with a webcomic...<br><br>As for my summer reading list: The Wheel of Time series, the rest of the Codex Alera (by Jim Butcher; I'm more anxious to read the next Dresden book than for Doctor Who and Sherlock to come back), and more webcomics and manga than I want to count. I also have a fair handful of visual novels and Dragon Age: Inquisition (both of which tend more towards "book" than "game" in the best possible ways).<br><br>This is me being conservative with my reading.<br></p>
