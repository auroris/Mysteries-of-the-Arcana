       <p>Thanks to some advertising, we had quite a few visitors yesterday. I want to say welcome to any new readers. We're glad to have you and hope you continue to read Mysteries of the Arcana. I'm J, the creator and writer. The art is done by Keith and has been since the comic first went live in 2009. This is our second storyline and we've no plans to stop at the moment. </p>
