       <p>So, I spent a little bit of time talking with J the other evening, and it seems he is considering shutting this space down. I get it, honestly, he's the one who has been paying for the domain name here, and all that. </p><p>Alongside that, I'm working on getting together an archive/backup of the comic here, over on the new site. For those of you who may have missed it in the last post, that link is <a href="https://legacyofthefool.com" target="_blank">https://legacyofthefool.com</a>.</p><p>The site is still under construction, but I've gotten a lot of work done there. I'll be removing my "test" posts and continue my thoughts and previews over there as well. </p><p>I know the captcha here is broken, I tried to ping JD about it, but it's been a long time, so, who knows, but everything for discourse is up over at the new site.<br><br>I forgot how much legwork went into setting up a site from jump, but I've got all the foundation set.</p><p>Now, about the new preview image!</p><p>Meet River Gryph. No, he's not our main character, but he is Alyx's boyfriend, and yes, he's a femboy.<br>I wanted to embrace some non-conventional character designs and such for this new story, and while it's not the sole focus, I do intend to  also dance back in time for a side story on how Alyx and River meet. <br></p><p>River is a Key, Alyx is not. I'll let you all mull over that one.<br><br>Until next post!</p><p>Keira W</p>

I would guess it's the data storage that makes the hosting expensive.<br></div>

<p class="comment_text"> </p><p class="comment_text">It's not the cost of hosting since I don't charge J hosting fees, this site is free, I pay for it. I pay for it because I have other sites on this server that are my own projects... just ones I don't work on. You know how it is.<br><br>JGray pays for his own domain name, which is connected to this site. I imagine he's tired of getting that yearly bill for a project he no longer works on.<br></p>
