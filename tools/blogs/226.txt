Well, enjoy your break, it's certainly well deserved! <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"></p> <p>I wonder how long Theresa will be bitter and grumpy for? Well, considering what she went through... I assume quite a bit of time unfortunately! I hope Chris' new (likely) shiny cloak will keep her happy in the mean time.</p> <p>Will we see Melody (Chris' mom) this chapter? The whole first chapter was about saving her (and seeing her unconcious for a panel or two), while she wasn't present at all in the second.</p> <p>I know that we can see her in the Vote Incentive, but that doesn't count <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"></p>
