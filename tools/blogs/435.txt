Come our next regular update day (that would be Monday the 24th) we'll be starting chapter 5! I am really looking forward to it.</p><p>In the meanwhile, I wonder, how have you enjoyed the webcomic trailers? I'm pondering adding this as a regular addition to the Mysteries of the Arcana site. Perhaps something akin to webcomic Wednesdays? Where each Wednesday I give a shout out to another webcomic. What do you think? Is that something that would interest you guys? It would not interrupt regular content, of course.</p><p>Today's comic, by the way, is <a href="https://www.comic-rocket.com/explore/samhain-night/" target="_blank">Samhain Night</a>. Not only is the creator an amazing lady but this is one of the best takes of classic Celtic mythology and modern fantasy I've ever ready. I really recommend it.</p><p>See you tomorrow!</p>
