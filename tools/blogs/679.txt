There have been a couple of times the site was unavailable, and at least once when it was replaced with a Chinese news page. </p><p>So, after doing a revamp of most of the system that makes these sites tick, I believe I've managed to close the loophole the attackers were exploiting.  I also managed to break J's ability to upload a new comic. Oops.  Please forgive me, I think it's been corrected now and you can return to your regularly scheduled programming.</p>
