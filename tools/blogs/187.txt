   <div id="avatar"><img src="//images/spacer.gif" border="0" alt="JGray"><br></div>    One very, very special reader has donated all the money we needed. Thank you. Keith's already ordered the parts. They'll arrive in early June so we aren't perfectly on track. So, next week we'll have black and white pages with hand lettering. This'll be interesting. Keith will color them in as soon as he is able. Right now he can scan but he doesn't have the processing power to run Photoshop and color.<br><br>Thank you again. I hated to have to do this but you came through when we needed help most.<br>
