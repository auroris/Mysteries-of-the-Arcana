       Today's page is dedicated to the mind-boggingly talented Dwayne McDuffie. He died this week at the age of 49. Mr. McDuffie was a writer for DC and Marvel, and a major force behind animated super heroes. His credits include the Fantastic Four, Justice League of America, Justice League Unlimited, and Ben 10: Ultimate Alien. <br><br>His legacy is best felt, however, through the characters of Milestone comics. Mr. McDuffie and others founded Milestone comics to create a more racially diverse, more inclusive population of superheroes. Milestone would eventually be purchased by DC comics. The lines most famous creation, Static, would become the star of the animated series, Static Shock. Static Shock would go on to become part of the animated DCU, connected to Batman: the Animated Series, Superman: the Animated Series, Batman Beyond, the Zeta Chronicles, Justice League, and Justice League Unlimited. Comicwise, all of Milestone's characters were folded into the DCU recently, with Static himself becoming a member of the Teen Titans.<br><br>The excellent blog, <a name="" target="_blank" classname="" class="" href="http://dcwomenkickingass.tumblr.com/">DC Women Kicking Ass</a> said it better than I ever could and I hope they don't mind me quoting here:<br><br>"I've told this story before, but I will tell it again. When the  Hostess cupcakes promotion happened last fall featuring Batman,  Superman, Flash and Green Lantern, my friend showed her son the box. He  took one look at it and said, "that's not the Green Lantern, the Green  Lantern is black." <p>And he is to millions of kids, because of Dwayne McDuffie. And Static  is a cool character for kids because of Dwayne McDuffie. And Vixen is  as well known as Black Canary to many people, because of Dwayne  McDuffie.</p> <p>His vision, his work, his belief that EVERYONE deserves to have a  superhero like them, shouldn't be forgotten. Must not be forgotten."</p><p>Static Shock remains my favorite of Mr. McDuffie's work and, in my opinion, the best of the animated DCU. <br></p><p>It would be wonderful if MotA readers would share their favorite McDuffie creations here, be they episodes or issues.</p><p>Safe journey, Mr. McDuffie. You remain a giant, standing shoulder to shoulder with Kirby, Lee, Ditko, and Gaiman. Thank you for your gifts to us.<br></p>
