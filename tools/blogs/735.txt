       <p>So, seems life has been doing distraction type things to J and myself as of late. Here's hoping to get through it as fast as possible and keeping you guys elbow deep in Mysteries of the Arcana.</p><p>Speaking of distractions, it looks like Chrys and Theresa have found a bit of that themselves. Shame on them, whenever I had to work on a vehicle it was always elbow deep in grease and on my back.</p><p>Anyway, bad puns aside, we'll see you guys next week.</p><p>Keith W.</p>
