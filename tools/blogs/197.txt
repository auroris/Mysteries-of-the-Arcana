<br>
<br>Real reason though? I think she feels that she bored Theresa to tears and in telling her story and lost an opportunity to spend more time with her. She killed the mood when her origin story involving her father were getting too detailed about him, and not about her. Darn one line cover ups about yourself are always a bummer. If only she talked about herself as a baby, maybe Theresa would have found that cute.</p>

Jeyl, you won't be satisfied until I put up a comic called "the Adventures of Baby Chrys" are you? <img src="/smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"><br></div></div>

<br>Oh, no sir. While I do like hearing about a character's history and how when it all boils down to her birth, we as readers get a better understanding of what kind of upbringing Chrys had. We just didn't get to see any of it! While she does delve into how she was brought up, but we don't get a single flash back image of her when she was a child, even though we got plenty of images of Mr Master, but he looks and sounds like a jerk. I don't care about Quest, I care about Chrystalline! Anyways, back to the subject at hand. I have several theories, but----

<p class="comment_text"> </p><p class="comment_text">You did learn quite a bit about Chrystalline's background, though! Being a dreamer and the relationship between her parents (and the odd love triangle between her parents and Kludge) were very important in developing who she is and how she approaches relationships - like this one with Theresa.<br><br>I am glad you care about Chrys, though. If people don't care about the characters, they won't care about the story. <br><br>On a more serious note, can you give me details on your OS and browser? I'll pass them along to JD and see if we can't cure your problem.<br></p>
