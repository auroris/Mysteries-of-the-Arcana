   <div id="avatar"><img src="//images/spacer.gif" border="0" alt="JGray"><br></div>    The events portrayed in this particular sequence of pages is disturbing. They were disturbing to write. For many, they will be disturbing to read. I could have put a content warning on them the same way I did on those pages with nudity (however artistic and in context that nudity is). I didn't. While the events portrayed are horrific, they aren't explicit and they are vital to understanding both Theresa's story and her character.<br><br>I don't want to appear insensitive to readers who are having trouble with Theresa's memories. What Debby is going through is something no one should ever have to experience. It is horrible, degrading, and evil. Unfortunately, it is too often part of our lives. <br><br>Debby's rape and what happened after became a defining moment in Theresa's life that propelled her down the path that led to the story presented in Mysteries of the Arcana. It needs to be here, front and center, on the main page, with no interruptions and no barriers.<br><br>Thank you for reading.<br>

<p class="Comment_text"> </p><p class="Comment_text"><span class="Forum_info">Guest post by "SoySauce"</span><br> There's always a chance that I'll go back to that, but at a slightly smaller scale. I'm only reading 19 comics at the moment since Today.com got shut down and that's how I kept track of my list. So basically, I'm just reading my favorites. Two of them are about done, and nine of them weren't on my list before. Checking 30 some comics every day had started becoming more of a hassle than a hobby, honestly.</p>
