Today's page is going to appear next Monday. I had a lot planned for last weekend that the storm shoved forward to this week. I've been playing catch-up and just haven't been in the right frame of mind for writing. <br><br>In the meanwhile, Genn prepared this very lovely filler. A peek into the future, maybe?
