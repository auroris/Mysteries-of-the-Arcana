If this were a Michael Bay film the camera would be all shaky as the lightning hit. If this were a Abrams film we'd have LENS FLARES! Honestly, I love the Royal Road effect. It is so simple but conveys the idea so well!</p><p>So, as a reminder! I am a writer and, as such, I have books for sale! What kind of books? Well, let's start off with Mysteries of the Arcana. You can buy chapters 1 and 2 of Mysteries of the Arcana on Amazon. Each book has a bonus story in it that isn't available anywhere else, fully illustrated by an amazing artist.</p><p><a href="http://amzn.com/B00S7LB620" target="_blank">Mysteries of the Arcana, Chapter 1.</a></p><p><a href="http://amzn.com/B00S6ZTYDA" target="_blank">Mysteries of the Arcana, Chapter 2.</a></p><p>In addition, I do RPG writing. I've written or contributed to a number of books for Pathfinder, which some people will recognize as D&amp;D 3.75. </p><p><a href="http://drivethrurpg.com/product/145261/Spellstaff-The-Magic-Users-Weapon" target="_blank">Spellstaff: The Magic User's Weapon</a> - Written entirely by me.

Expanded Options gives some new archetypes and ideas for Spheres of Power. I contributed several archetypes.</p><p><a href="http://drivethrurpg.com/product/146843/Call-to-Arms-TenFoot-Poles-April-Fools-Edition" target="_blank">Call to Arms: Ten-Foot Pole</a> - We put this out for April Fool's but I think there's some very neat stuff in here. Some of it silly, some of it useful. Best of all, this book is pay what you want! I contributed a few items and creatures and ideas to the book.</p><p>There you go! Everything I currently have for sale, either as a writer or an editor. Sales of these books really help me. They convince publishers I'm worth hiring and, in several cases, actually net me a little cash. So, please take a look at them. Thank you!</p><p>See you Monday!</p>
