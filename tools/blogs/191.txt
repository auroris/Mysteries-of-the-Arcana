       <style type="text/css"> 	 	</style> <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The origins of Chrystalline's father reach back to my teen years. Back then, he was my alter ego. I could use my imagination to project him into any story. He could go gallivanting with Taran the Assistant Pig-Keeper in the Prydian Chronicles, cross the a galaxy far, far away with Luke Skywalker, or wander the mean streets of Boston with Spenser and Hawk. I'll admit, he was a total Mary Sue.</p>  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">As time went on and I matured my mental stories about Chrys' father wandered away from taking part in other people's adventures. He began to have adventures of his own. I'm not sure when he had a daughter but he did and at some point, I realized my imagination plays were staring her more and more and him less and less. By the time I began developing Mysteries of the Arcana as a webcomic there was no question that she would take center stage.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">By the way, in case there was any question, Chrys' dad is the guy who looks like her. The other two? Kludge and Melody.<br></p>

<p class="comment_text"> </p><p class="comment_text">Chrys's dad was born (in my head) in the late 80s/early 90s so that makes a sort of sense. <br></p>
