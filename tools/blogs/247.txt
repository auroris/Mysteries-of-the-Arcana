   <h1>The Top Ten Women in Games...</h1>
   <div class="post_body">
   <div id="avatar"><img src="//images/spacer.gif" border="0" alt="JGray"><br></div>    So, here's the gist of it. I've made a list of the top ten video game women of 2010. The list is based on my personal gaming experience of the year. Thus, to qualify a woman had to:<br><br>A) Be in a video game.<br>B) Be in a video game I played this year.<br><br>Video game and computer game are interchangable terms here. <br><br>Instead of putting up a new blog posting every day, I'm gonna just put up this one post so people can reply on it. What do you think of my picks? What would your picks be and why? I'm hoping this will be the most commented blog entry on MotA ever!<br><br>Also, happy holidays!<br>

<p class="Comment_text"> </p><p class="Comment_text"><span class="Forum_info">Guest post by "Samantha"</span><br> Hmmm... it has to be limited to games we played THIS year?<br><br>Like JD above, I spend a lot of time playing WoW.&nbsp; So two from WoW would be: Lady Jane Proudmoore who tried to reason with King Varian not to go totally anti-orc nutso. My second from WoW would have to be Sylvanas for defying Thrall and making the huge land grab knowing the rest of the horde would be against her.<br><br>Non-WoW..hahaha, Nancy Drew! My daughter enjoy playing the ND games together. <br><br>Also, I'm SURE I played Metroid at some point this year, so I have to say Samus Aran.<br><br>MERRY CHRISTMAS! Happy Holidays! Joyful December! and&nbsp; Prosperous and Smiley New Year!<br></p>

<p class="Comment_text"> </p><p class="Comment_text">Nancy Drew certainly has come a long way from the early days. Granted, she was always more independent than many young women were "supposed" to be, but I'm pretty pleased with the computer game versions of her.<br><br>Ayra, I love Rosie, of course, but I think it is one thing to have courage when you're lugging around a machine gun and another when all you have is a pen and a notebook.<br><br>I don't play World of Warcraft (or any other MMORPG) so I'll have to take people's words on those characters.<br><br>Samus is, of course, always awesome, but I didn't play any Metroid games this year.<br></p>

<p class="Comment_text"> </p><p class="Comment_text"><span class="Forum_info">Guest post by "finiteHP"</span><br> Came in here to post about Terra being the first female lead in a Final Fantasy, but Daedalus beat me to it.  Everyone I've talked to that has played FFVI agrees that Terra is the main character.  Not only is she the first party member to show up, she's also the one that has the biggest connection to everything that is happening.</p>

<p class="Comment_text"> </p><p class="Comment_text">I have been schooled. Indeed, Terra of Final Fantasy VI does predate Lightning. Still, I believe that my choice of Lightning as number five stands. So many female leads in JRPGs tend to be either clueless little girls or shrewish bimbos its nice to see one that is capable and strong.<br></p>

<p class="Comment_text"> </p><p class="Comment_text"><span class="Forum_info">Guest post by "Ayra"</span><br> </p><p>Happy new year!</p> <p>I've never played Primal (Or seen more than the box art) so won't comment on that one!</p> <p>Elena wouldn't have came to mind, but... It's a great pick, so thumbs up on that one! <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"></p> <p>Regarding the whole Terra/Celes thing, I personally view Terra as the lead in the first half, Celes the lead in the second half. Considering that Terra is actually an optional character in the 2nd half of the game, I definitively can't see her as the "one main character". But that's just semantics I suppose!</p> <p>I definitively agree that it's nice to have a strong female main character like Lightning... Although I can't say I liked the game much. I haven't finished it actually (I think I have still like 25-40 hours to go actually), although I probably should someday... Story was interesting, but the battles felt extremely tedious and not worth going through after some time. I'll give it another try sometime.</p> <p>If I had to give my own #1 based on games played this year... I'd say female Commander Shepard from Mass Effect. Lenneth Valkyrie from Valkyrie Profile would get my all time vote though, with Nel Zelpher from Star Ocean 3 at #2.</p>

I hope steam gets it so I can get it on my computer.  Last I heard the reason the sequel is going to be a while because they are keeping the development team small to keep it pure and up to par with the first one</p>

<p class="Comment_text"> </p><p class="Comment_text">Ayra, very good call on Shepard. As you can see, I agree with you there and made femShep my #1 choice.<br><br>J, as far as I can tell, Beyond Good and Evil HD is only going to be available on the PS3 and 360. But if it sells well, it isn't hard to translate from the 360 to Windows so, hopefully it'll show up on Steam.<br><br>Soysauce, I considered GlaDos but, unfortunately, I played Portal in 2009, not 2010. Otherwise she might have made the list.<br></p>
