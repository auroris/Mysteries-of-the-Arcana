       And so, we've reached the end of our daily run. We'll be going back to our normal Monday/Thursday schedule. So, no new comic until Thursday.<br><br>You've all seen a lot, these last two weeks. Events without narration. Theresa's memories. Nightmares. Some aspects of what happened might not be clear yet and that's alright. I promise, before this chapter ends, what happened to Debby and Theresa's part in it will all be explained. Please, be patient. Feel free to discuss it, of course. I'll answer what I can without spoiling what's to come.<br>

<p class="comment_text"> </p><p class="comment_text">Fortunately, Keith only had to draw the background (the goo Debby and trees) once. After that, it was the equivalent of drawing a single panel per page. And one of the big reasons we did this in a daily run was just that - we didn't want people to go through this for two months.<br></p>
