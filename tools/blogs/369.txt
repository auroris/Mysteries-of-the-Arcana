       This page was harder to write than you might think. Explaining background/world information is often hard. The truth is, I've been meaning to talk about both the Inn's security system and how it is everyone seems to speak English since chapter one. The right moment has just never come up. <br><br>This chapter, however, is specifically dedicated to explaining background and world details! Thus, this was the perfect time. I just wanted to write the page in a way that was at least a little entertaining. I don't expect anyone to laugh but hopefully I got a smile or two out of you.<br><br>Don't forget the fanart contest! Send us poetry, art, stories, photographs, pictures of your dolls cosplaying... whatever suits your fancy, so long as it is MotA related! The deadline is the 13th of May and the winner will get a prototype Mysteries of the Arcana tarot card!<br>
