       <p>As promised, here's an update on Wednesday! We'll also have one on Friday since y'all are such good haiku writers.</p><p>Did you know that Keith is the part-time colorist over at <a href="http://grrlpowercomic.com/" target="_blank">GrrlPower</a>? He doesn't color every page but he does color some of them, allowing Dave B more time to work on pencils, inks, lettering, and the rest of the gig. Play a game! Try to figure out which pages Keith colored and which Dave colored! It can be fun!</p><p>See you Friday!</p>
