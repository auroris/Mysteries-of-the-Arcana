Keith's computer is dying. He's managed to keep it alive enough to get online to tell me about the problems and to transfer data to an external drive. What he needs now is a new motherboard, new hard drive, few other things. The rest of the machine can be salvaged.<br><br>And the money to pay for it. So, here I am, asking you to donate if you possibly can. We need $200 to pay for Keith's upgrades. In order to keep the comic going on schedule we need the money as quickly as possible. Otherwise, the comic will continue but there will either be a reduction in quality (certainly no color but maybe line art, since Keith inks by hand) or a severe slow-down in output.<br><br>Thanks, folks. I'm sorry to have to ask for this.<br>
