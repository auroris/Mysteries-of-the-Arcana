       <p>Yep. Chrys forgot that little detail. The abundant lack of acorns with which the viquirrels may fill their furry bellies so they can sleep through the winter like good little bushy tailed tree rodents.</p><p>Back to gaming! In addition to playing Fallout 4, I'm also playing quite a bit of <a href="http://sentinelsofthemultiverse.com/" target="_blank">Sentinels of the Multiverse</a>. This is a cooperative, deck based (but not deck building) superhero card game and one I recommend highly. It comes in both tabletop/physical and digital form. Digital form is fairly cheap and has both single player and cross-platform multiplayer modes. That means if you buy it on Steam or Android you can play with me as I use it on my iPad. </p><p>If you happen to pick up Sentinels of the Multiverse and want to do a multiplayer match with me, give me a shout and we'll set it up.</p><p>See you Monday!</p>
