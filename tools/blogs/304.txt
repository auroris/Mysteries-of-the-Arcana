Once upon a time, I started making up stories about a dashing, interdimensional traveler. It wasn't Chrys. Or Theresa. It was Quest.

I'm very interested to see what happens since they have both been caught. Don't feel too bad about the Mary Sue-ing, we all do it at one time or another.

<p class="Comment_text"> </p><p class="Comment_text"><span class="Forum_info">Guest post by "James"</span><br> I'm sorry but it must be said. The art work is not doing it for me as it did in previous pages. It's like giving away your Farrari for a Taurus, a cool car to show off for a family car everyone had. Her art work maybe good for other comics but for this one, the original artist style was what brought people to it. I only stay for the story because it is still interesting. <br><br>I think you people are being a little too polite. I'm not saying we should be against simple forms of art, but, honesty rather then "don't hate me" politeness isn't a bad thing to practice once in a while, it may even help in some good way.<br></p>

<p class="Comment_text"> </p><p class="Comment_text"><span class="Forum_info">Guest post by "Gillsing"</span><br> I'm guessing James thought Xade was calling him "a zero" with the "Loved the zeros comment on the one before." Which actually seems to refer to the last panel of page 249, and not at all to the previous comment.<br><br>A lot of times it's a good idea to turn the other cheek at perceived insults or attacks, because sometimes they're just mistakes on someone's part, and retaliation just makes things worse. And hey, even if it's an actual verbal attack, it already reflects poorly on the attacker, so as far as I'm concerned, there is really no point in name-calling even as retaliation.</p>

I have just been picked on enough to figure out the difference between being picked on and <em>not</em> being picked on.

<p class="Comment_text"> </p><p class="Comment_text"><span class="Forum_info">Guest post by "Xade"</span><br> </p><div>I was not saying anything about anyone, James, I was talking about the "few zeros short of a price tag" comment by the pirate to his lackey. I was in no way even considering attacking you or any other person who commented, James. the "one before" was speaking of the comic before. Since you never mentioned or even hinted at the word zero or anything, a cool headed person would have known that I was speaking of the comic. You took that completely wrong and twisted my innocent comment in an effort to start something. If anything you just showed off your chair warmer, congratulations, James. It makes me wonder why you must take everything as a personal insult and imagine people attacking wherever you go.</div><div><br></div><div>If you wish to discuss issues growing up, then I shall. When your own father makes you feel unwelcomed into the world for being a girl and verbally, physically, and almost sexually abuses you then you expect to have issues. I grew up learning how to duck, dodge and hide from the male who donated his genes to me. You might have been born a minority or who knows what, but at least peer pressure is all you had to live with. I had to live with a father who wanted to initiate me into womanhood, AND classmates that picked on me because I misbehaved, had a speech impediment because my teeth were kicked in, I had a temper, and ....well, you get the idea I had a lot of issues growing up. However, I rose above my past and learned to not be a defensive person. Instead, I do my utmost to be a kind and warm hearted young woman, who does not take everything said around me wrong. I am sorry that you took my comments wrong, I wrote that comment soon after waking up, and apparently I forgot to double check to ensure that my words could not be misread. I should have said "in the comic before" or "in the previous comic" instead of "in the one before" so no one could think I was attacking them. Of course I could never have foreseen that my innocent comment could be taken the wrong way, I am not all knowing. JGray asked me to comment a long time ago on twitter, now I am very sorry that I did.</div>

Wow, what an incredibly thin skin you have there, James. Besides, that "zeros" statement was clearly aimed at Elizabeth because the smiley has zeros in it. Lose the chip on your shoulder, ok? You'll find life considerably more enjoyable if you do. If you can't, I suggest finding a nice padded room somewhere where they give you regular doses of "happy juice" whether you want it or not.
