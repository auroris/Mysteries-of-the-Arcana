       <p>So, for any of you who aren't aware, I'm a ridiculously huge Star Wars fan, and if you guys are, then you know that today marks the premier of Episode IX, The Last Jedi.</p><p>In that spirit, as is my typical thing, I wanted to do something Star Wars-y with the crew. At the same time, I also wanted to do something a little different, and lean more toward a collage, instead of just a group "pic". Honestly, I really do enjoy how this sketch came out, and let me pose a fun question!</p><p>Up to this point (not counting The Last Jedi), what has been your favorite Star Wars film thus far?</p><p>Mine is still very very much Empire.</p>

<p class="comment_text"> </p><p class="comment_text"><br> I think Empire probably is the best, objectively. But because of my age when it came out, Return of the Jedi holds a special place in my heart. It also ended the original trilogy and felt like a nice cap on an amazing adventure.</p>
