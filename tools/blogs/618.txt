       <p>Theresa's in a clear combat situation here. Her party's been attacked by someone and that someone has made a nasty, potentially life-ending veiled threat.

<p class="comment_text"> </p><p class="comment_text"><br> My opinion as to why in short? Trauma is a bitch. Mental trauma doubly so.<br><br><br>On a completely unrelated note: YES! The Letters from the Flaming Crab 2016 edition is funded! And we're getting some commissioned art even. I was kinda hoping at the start that we'd make it until colour illustrations, but actually got afraid we'd not make it at all midway through, when the numbers just didn't seem to rise anymore. So mostly I'm just happy and eagerly awaiting the letters, including my captained month of May. :D<br></p>

<p class="comment_text"> </p><p class="comment_text"><br> It stems back to Theresa's strict Catholic (or Christian, I forget...)  upbringing, if I remember, particularly during the raid on the Inn, when she had to kill Ruby, <a name="" target="" classname="" class="" href="/comics/521/">which caused her a great deal of trauma and pain</a>, <a name="" target="" classname="" class="" href="/comics/520/">even though she was saving Chrys' life (as well as her own)</a>.<br><br>Even though she is (as she was then) morally justified in killing to prevent the innocent deaths that will certainly arise if Mister MistEerie were to have their way.<br></p>

<p class="comment_text"> </p><p class="comment_text"><br> Fucking hell, the classic "Change your appearance to mess with a protagonist's head" trick? Theresa, what you're seeing is already missing a quarter of their head and half their brain to go with it, shooting them would be a mercy because whatever life that's available from that ain't worth living.</p><div><br></div><div>But then again I'm jaded as fuck so that's probably something I'd only find easy to do. Then again the whole appearance change also wouldn't work on me since I've seen that trick too many times not to notice it. I was going to say not that stupid but this is more of an emotional play than an intelligence one. That said, here comes dramatic, and not all that legal practice, therapy.</div><div><br></div><div>Edit: wait no, that's a third of her head. Either way, still ain't the person you know and regret shooting, put them back down in the ground so they can rest.</div><br><p class="comment_info">Last edited by Guest<br>Edited 1 time(s).</p>
