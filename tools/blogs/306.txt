I've had several queries for the position of artist over here on MotA and, so far, a few audition pages. I'm waiting for a few more and then I'll make my decision.

<br><br>Erm, if you're talking of everyone saying how bitchy she was, well, that's sorta because the belated April Fools joke wasn't understood as such so everyone, including Sarrah, took it at face value. And people aren't nice to people they perceive as not very nice people and nicer to people who seem nice...it feels like your blaming your readers for coming to your defense and trashing her and/or her art in ways they really wouldn't have if you hadn't started a joke that made the whole world cry (BeeGees)...<br>That might not be your intention, I dunno, but it sorta feels that way...<br>

It's okay to make bad decision, just as long as you learned from them so if you want to try it again, you'd know how to do it better, without hurting your friends.<br></p>

<p class="Comment_text"> </p><p class="Comment_text">Greg, I don't mean the April Fool's joke but, rather, how much of a thrashing her art got. Yes, artists often need thick skins. However, most of the people auditioning aren't professionals and don't have a lot of experience. I think the "American Idol" process is destructive and would prefer to nurture young talent, not crush it.<br><br>James, after I've made my decision I'll ask all the artists involved if I can post their audition pages in the gallery. I do want to share them, just not as part of a 'vote on your favorite' process.<br></p>

<p class="Comment_text"> </p><p class="Comment_text">I have great respect for Jeph Jacques and for Dan Shive, for that matter. Both started out with so-so art and improved considerably over the years. That said, the vision I have for MotA is fairly complex, detailed, and action oriented. The art has to be able to convey my writing. MY art would not. Maybe it might after years of constant work but in the meanwhile, readers would have to deal with a story that was often confusing because the art couldn't keep up with the writing... and since we've already had two years of fairly solid art, it would be a let down for the readers who have grown used to a certain level of quality from MotA in all departments.<br></p>
