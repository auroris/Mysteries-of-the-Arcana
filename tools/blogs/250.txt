<p class="comment_text"> </p><p class="comment_text"><span class="forum_info">Guest post by "Wolfgang"</span><br> Do dogboy's people just suck at driving stakes or is Theresa insanely strong (or maybe the ground is just very bad at holding stakes)? In my experience, pulling a stake straight out is often difficult. Pulling one out sideways seems like it would be more difficult. It might be possible to loosen it with repeated little tugs, but that seems more time consuming than what we see here.<br><br>Only thing I don't like about the top ten is that I couldn't find them to look back on them.<br></p>

<p class="comment_text"> </p><p class="comment_text">The coloring looks great. Good job Keith!&nbsp; And seriously if Dogboy wanted Theresa dead or contained, she'd be dead or contained.&nbsp; She is totally spoiling a brilliant plan of William's to save her bitchy ass.</p>

I had already read about <em>Beyond Good and Evil</em>, and while it seems like a game I could enjoy, I doubt that I'll ever get around to play it. Looks like my current computer can't even handle 3D graphics, but maybe I'll buy a new one this year. <em>Maybe</em>.</p>
