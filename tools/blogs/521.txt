       <p>Sorry about missing Monday's update but I have a good excuse. Really!</p><p>First, though, notice that today's page is the official on-the-website debut of the Hierophant Card. Those of you who got the chapter 1 ebooks from the Kickstarter got to see a glimpse of the card in the bonus story, Narrow, but today's view is much better. And speaking of the ebooks...</p><p>I am proud to announce that Mysteries of the Arcana chapter 1: More Heavens and Earths and Mysteries of the Arcana chapter 2: All the Way Down are now officially on sale as ebooks! </p><p><strong>Each book contains a bonus story not available on our website.</strong></p><p>Chapter 1 is $12.99 and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mysteries-Arcana-Chapter-Heavens-Earths-ebook/dp/B00S7LB620/" target="_blank">available at Amazon</a>. If you would prefer the book in PDF format, you can also <a href="http://comics.drivethrustuff.com/product/142753/Mysteries-of-the-Arcana-Chapter-1-More-Heavens-and-Earths" target="_blank">purchase it from DriveThruComics</a>.</p><p>Chapter 2 is $7.99 and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mysteries-Arcana-chapter-All-Down-ebook/dp/B00S6ZTYDA/" target="_blank">also available at Amazon</a>. Again, if you prefer your ebooks in PDF format you can <a href="http://comics.drivethrustuff.com/product/142754/Mysteries-of-the-Arcana-Chapter-2-All-the-Way-Down" target="_blank">purchase it from DriveThruComics</a>.</p><p>If you prefer to read your comics via ComiXology there'll be a wait. We've submitted the books to them but the ComiXology review process takes several months to complete. I'll announce when the books are up there.</p><p>If you do buy the books or even if you already own them via the Kickstarter please take a moment to write a review on Amazon or DriveThruComics (or both!). Reviews help sell books and we can really use the sales. So, this is me begging for reviews. Honest ones, though. I always prefer honesty.</p><p>See you Monday!</p>
