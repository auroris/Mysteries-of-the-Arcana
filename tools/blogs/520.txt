I wonder what kind of fights that causes them...</p><p>Speaking of nothing involving LEGO Kludge! By now, hopefully all eligible Kickstarters have received their PDFs of Mysteries of the Arcana chapters 1 and 2. What did you think of the bonus stories? With chapter 1, we had Narrow, a story that takes place between chapters 1 and 2. With chapter 2, we had Fly Away Home, a prequel that tells the story of how Mandrake came to live at the Inn. I'd love to hear your impressions of those two stories. Drop us a comment and let us know, please! Like all creators, I thrive on feedback.</p><p>And don't forget, <a href="http://www.patreon.com/user?u=452395" target="_blank">Mysteries of the Arcana is now a Patreon supported webcomic</a>! Our goal right now is to raise $320 a month so we can bring you MotA twice a week. At present, we are at $247 a month with 10 patrons. That's enough to allow MotA to be posted once a week. Please consider being our patron, even if for only $1 a month. 20 people pledging $1 a month is just as good as 1 person pledging $20 a month. Every little bit counts to help pay for the comic.</p><p>See you Monday!</p>
