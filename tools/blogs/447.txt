That being said, life is not without its perils and interruptions. There is a medical ordeal going on right now, and it's played havoc with my schedule this past week.</p><p>Tomorrow we will be visiting the doctor, and hopefully getting some way to manage things until surgery time. I won't go into much more detail than that, in order to protect privacy, but as it is going on in my home, it does impact me quite a lot.</p><p>In the meantime, enjoy another DC inspired cosplay with the ladies. I actually had the Powergirl joke popping around my head for a bit, and it's fun to get to put it up here, for you guys to see.</p><p>So, Power Girl and Huntress, MotA cosplay style.</p><p>Things should be back on track for Thursday to resume our regularly scheduled Chapter 5.</p><p>Regards,</p><p>Keith W.</p>
