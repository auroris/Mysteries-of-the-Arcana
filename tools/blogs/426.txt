Look at that poster. It is like Darth Maul and Chrys have a love child who likes to hang out with very tiny women! How can you not go and give her a try? Be warned, though. Chirault has quite the archive to read through. Over seven hundred pages. Be prepared to be entertained for quite a while.</p><p>I'm in the middle of preparing the four tarot cards people will be receiving as rewards for the Kickstarter. It isn't quite as easy as I had hoped it would be because of an error in judgement I made. Word to the wise - if you intend to offer something printed as a reward for a Kickstarter make sure you work out the printing dimensions ahead of time. </p>
