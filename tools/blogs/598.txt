       <p>To everyone that celebrates Christmas, may I wish you a merry one! I hope the next few days are wonderful and bright for you.</p><p>We'll be back come Monday. For now, enjoy this gorgeous holiday filler. Keith was obviously inspired by a recent movie of some sort. I'm not sure which one, of course, but I'm sure you can figure it out!</p><p>For those who are interested, this year I began writing for small press RPG companies. I'm including a full list of books below, including links to where to buy them. I earn royalties on the books marked with a star. Buying those books helps support me and, therefore, Mysteries of the Arcana. Please consider doing so with your holiday money. I appreciate your support in whatever form it come in. Thank you for being part of the Mysteries of the Arcana family.</p><p>P.S. If you do buy any of these books please consider leaving a review. If you're buying a book that Keith illustrated, make sure to mention the art in the review. That lets the publisher know he or she hire Keith again!</p><p><a href="http://drivethrurpg.com/product/146843/Call-to-Arms-TenFoot-Poles-April-Fools-Edition">Call to Arms: Ten-Foot Pole</a>.
