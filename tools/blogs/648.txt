       <p>And here we go! The final page of chapter six. Wow. What a long, strange trip this one has been. Chrys' hair is shorter. Theresa's hair is longer. We've learned more about the bad guys behind everything. We got to see squirrel people and button men! </p><p>Wow.</p><p>Thank you for reading the chapter. Keith and I really appreciate it. Creators really do need an audience. </p><p>Now! We'll be taking the rest of the week off. On Monday, the first page of Chapter Seven will be posted. Short story number one will be the backup story from the trade version of chapter one. Those of you who backed the Kickstarter for this chapter have already read it but I thought it was time to share it with everyone else. </p><p>BTW, Musicalife asked if people who bought the <strong>Castle Falkenstein</strong> supplements I will be writing will need the core rule book for the system. The answer is you might be able to enjoy the writing without the core book but you will need it for playing. <a href="http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/2370/Castle-Falkenstein" target="_blank">You can buy it here</a>. I suspect there might be sales on it in the future but I can't promise that.</p><p>Thank you for reading and supporting Mysteries of the Arcana. We love you all.</p><p>See you next Monday!</p>
