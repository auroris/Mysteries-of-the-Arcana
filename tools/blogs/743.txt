       <p>Of all the fantastical places we've gone in MotA, one place we haven't seen much of at all since Chapter 1 (minus the short stories), is our Earth. After some thinking, I decided it might be kinda fun to see Theresa standing back on familiar home ground, even basking a bit in the rain as she casts a backward glance to someone.</p><p>So, while we're still battling life things, enjoy this little peek at Theresa, back home again, in far better spirits than the first time we saw her.</p>
