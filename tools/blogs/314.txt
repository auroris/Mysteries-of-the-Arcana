I just didn't get to see it until recently.<br><br>All is well here. There was some water damage but not much. Had to clean out the fridge but we have power back and are about to go out shopping.<br><br>Normally I just let this sit in the background, but it would be very, very nice if people who could afford to do so would donate to the comic. Replacing groceries, making repairs to ensure that our basement won't flood again, and so forth are going to make things tight. The comic will not stop but every bit helps. Recently, a couple of people made donations (including one very large one). I'll send thank you shouts to those people later. <br><br>Right now, I've got to go out and fix stuff.<br>
