   <div id="avatar"><img src="//images/spacer.gif" border="0" alt="JGray"><br></div>    One of the best parts of this storyline? I get to highlight that Theresa and William are, in a lot of ways, alike. They both have a warrior's mentality and a strong, tactical sense. And, as we'll point out later on, they're both willing to make command decisions without the consensus or even knowledge of others involved.<br><br>Of course, Mandrake and Chrys have a lot in common with each other, too. <br>

If I had just added the way of leaving the camp I'd be completely right! <img src="//smilies/smile.gif" alt="Smile" border="0"></p> <p>With the acidity of regular ants and everything, I hope Theresa won't end up with a giant rash because she rode those! And let's hope those ants are well trained enough so that they don't attack her instead...</p> <p>I do agree that Theresa and William are alike in a lot of ways... Does this mean that we'll eventually have Theresa forget/change her orientation and that she'll end up going out with Dog Boy instead, leaving fans of Mysteries of the Arcana across the world boil in despair and frustration?</p>
